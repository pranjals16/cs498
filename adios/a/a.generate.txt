 *  where's  your  box  .  with  all  the  food  in  it  #
 *  she  got  her  assessment  last  week  .  #
 *  so  the  health  visitor  said  that  she was  going to  .  she was  taller  #
 *  she  has  an  imaginary  friend  .  #
 *  an  imaginary  friend  .  #
 *  I think  she  might  be  hungry  well  what  we  ...  #
 *  careful  .  away  from  that  #
 *  we'll  set  her  up  on the  settee  and  you can  feed  her  there  .  #

 *  oh  yeah  and  the  Queen  dropped  in  for  her  tea  last  night  .  #
 *  just  brought  xxx  but it  did  .  #
 *  and  she was  in  stitches  did you know  the  way  you  can't  laugh  .  you're  #
 *  but  honestly  it says  the  Queen's  here  for  her  tea  .  #
 *  and  where's  Johnston  today  #
 *  who's  that  #
 *  take  your  finger  out of  your  mouth  please  Barbara  #
 *  get  out of the  muck  Johnston  .  #
 *  did you  #
 *  is  it  not  too  cold  for  him  #
 *  oh  has  he  got  a  hat  on  aswell  that's  good  .  #
 *  has  he  got  a  scarf  on  too  #
 *  aye  actually  it was  talking  very  fast  .  #
 *  she  knew  what  everything  she  wanted  to  say  but  I was  coming  out  #
 *  so  we're  trying  to get  her  to  slow  down  a wee  bit  when  she's  #
 *  no  she's  doing  very  well  I  must  say  .  #
 *  some  of  the  things  she  comes  off  with  are  comical  though  .  #
 *  would you  show  Cathy  how  that  works  #
 *  maybe  Cathy  would  like  it  .  #
 *  else you  like  some  #
 *  and who  did you  have  #
 *  what do you call it  make  you  #
 *  Readybrek  #
 *  did  I  make  you  cornflakes  #
 *  I'm  sorry  .  #
 *  what do you call  we  do  with  her  #
 *  will  I  get  her  out  #
 *  ohmygoodness  you'd  better  change  that  nappie  #
 *  and  how  did  your  kids  get  over  it  #
 *  and where  do you  get  her  for  her  birthday  or  anything  #
 *  yes  .  #
 *  she's  got  that  she's  got  an  iron  and  an  ironing  board  funny  enough  #
 *  I'm  up  from  half  six  this  morning  doing  the  ironing  .  #
 *  and  you  do you want to  see  me  ironing  #
 *  xxx  Peter  was  up  from  half  six  so  I'm  wakened  .  #
 *  it says  get  up  and  make  me  a cup of  tea  .  #
 *  so  while  it was  up  here's  me  right  ...  #
 *  yes  yes  .  #
 *  once  I'm  wakened  that's  me  .  #
 *  I'm not  one  that  ...  #
 *  no  I  couldn't  go  back  over  to  sleep  again  .  #
 *  but  we're  starting  to get  her  into  a wee bit of  a  routine  going  #
 *  I've  sort of  said  nine  o'clock  which  I don't  think  is  unreasonable  #
 *  she'd  got  into  the  habit  .  #
 *  one  night  I was  a  quarter  to  one  before  I  could  get  her  off  .  #
 *  no  I was  too  much  it was  just  getting  too  much  far  far  too  much  .  #
 *  apart  from  anything  the  two  of  us  were  not  even  getting  a  #
 *  no  so  we  can't  do  that  .  #
 *  now  whether  she  wants  to  or  not  she  goes  up  at  nine  .  #
 *  she's  in  a  double  bed  now  .  #
 *  we  have  two  double  beds  she  doesn't  sleep  in  a  single  one  now  you  #
 *  no  I  didn't  .  #
 *  I  must  say  once  you  get  her  to  sleep  she  wouldn't  .  #
 *  ohmygoodness  #
 *  once  you  would  get  her  to  sleep  she  wouldn't  waken  .  #
 *  she  wouldn't  waken  or  come  into  you  or  anything  like  that  .  #
 *  ah  but  ...  #
 *  no  we  never  .  the  gate  whatever  I was  the  top  of  our  stairs  must  #
 *  and it  didn't  fit  .  #
 *  Peter  always  meant  to get  a wee bit of  wood  to  put  down  it  .  #
 *  and  he  never  did  so  eh  .  just  had  no  need  for  it  really  .  #
 *  uhhuh  xxx  .  #
 *  uhhum  .  #
 *  well  the  bed  that  we  had  ...  #
 *  that's  why  mine  have  it  at  the  bottom  .  #
 *  I don't  think  that  Cathy  wants  to  see  that  .  #
 *  you  just  pretend  .  #
 *  her  pottie's  there  .  #
 *  why  don't you  put  her  on the  pottie  to  see  if  she'll  do  something  #
 *  no  I  must  admit  that is  more  my  fault  than  anything  cause  I'm  lazy  #
 *  that was  another  thing  the  health  visitor  said  .  #
 *  well  she says  I'm  waiting  for  the  better  weather  coming  in  .  #
 *  she's  wearing  .  though  .  do you know  the  pants  that  you  pull  up  #
 *  but  ...  #
 *  the  summer  I  let  her  run  about  the  back  in the  wee  toweling  #
 *  I  have  a  load  of  them  .  #
 *  is  she  crying  #
 *  Barbara  cries  when  she  gets  her  hair  brushed  did you know  .  #
 *  you  wouldn't  think  it  sure  you  wouldn't  #
 *  see  maybe  I  just  don't  notice  it  like  you  xxx  .  #
 *  uhhuh  .  #
 *  no  I  probably  don't  notice  it  as  much  .  #
 *  seems  to  be  fine  do you know  she's  ...  #
 *  she was  in the  hospital  and  they  took  her  in  you see  .  #
 *  eh  .  she  took  an  angina  attack  .  #
 *  at  least  they  think  it was  an  angina  attack  .  #
 *  of  course  it was  a  week  later  before  she  went  in  .  #
 *  will  you  change  her  that  here  #
 *  go  into  your  box  and  get  talcum  powder  .  put  some  on  her  .  #
 *  that  would be  a good  idea  .  #
 *  but  she'll  just  haveto  take  it  a bit  easier  .  #
 *  well  I  wouldn't  stop  it  to  tell  you  the  truth  .  #
 *  I know  .  #
 *  uhhuh  well  now  I  had  ...  #
 *  if  I  had  like  .  if  we  had  any  more  .  #
 *  then  I'll  haveto  give  work  up  .  #
 *  because  neither  two  of  them  my  mother  my  mother  in  law  or  my  mummie  #
 *  she's  too  much  of  a  handful  to  watch  another  one  .  #
 *  so  eh  .  I  .  #
 *  well  the  nursery  .  it was  ...  #
 *  xxx  .  #
 *  do  they  only  take  them  for  a  year  now  but  #
 *  and  you see  she's  two  years  to  go  .  #
 *  she'll  not  start  school  until  she's  five  .  #
 *  well  that  one  ...  #
 *  in  Monkstown  which  is  where  I  would  haveto  try  to get  her  do you know  #
 *  but  there  is  one  in the  school  we're  going to  look  into  .  #
 *  you can  send  them  ...  #
 *  any  day  that  you  want  .  #
 *  Friars  Bush  I  would  like  her  to  go  to  .  #
 *  we  don't  have  a  primary  school  like  Whitehouse  do  .  #
 *  now  they  do  have  a  playschool  so  they  do  .  #
 *  what  .  Whitehouse  or  ...  #
 *  Friar's  Bush  .  #
 *  see  I  even  had  thought  about  Whitehouse  cause I  always  liked  #
 *  my  mother  in  law  says  Ruth  Friar's  Bush  have  a  great  pass  rate  for  #
 *  plus  that's  where  Andrena  and  Peter  they  all  went  there  .  #
 *  yes I  has  a  better  chance  of  getting  in  there  xxx  .  #
 *  ah  but  with  my  mummie  keeping  her  with  playschool  I'd  haveto  ...  #
 *  well  my  mother  in  law  is  giving  up  work  now  oh I  is  .  #
 *  she  works  in the  Polytech  .  #
 *  so  they're  getting  voluntary  redundancy  so  they  are  .  #
 *  well  at  least  she's  near  pension  age  anyhow  .  #
 *  so  it was  one  of  the  ones  xxx  .  #
 *  but she  got  a wee bit of  money  out of  it  so  .  #
 *  and I says  you  should  just  take  it  .  #
 *  you'll  put  your  day  in  rightly  so  you  will  .  #
 *  so  ...  #
 *  Alice  will  be  there  so  they'll  be  able  to  take  her  and  bring  her  #
 *  but  the  play  group  or  playschool  now  I'm  all  for  going  but  the  #
 *  I think  we've  loads  of  time  .  #
 *  that  wee  .  see  that  mothers  and  toddlers  she  goes  to  it's  great  .  #
 *  they're  great  now  .  now  what  what  she  learns  .  #
 *  I was  thinking  then  ...  #
 *  uhhuh  .  #
 *  well  the  only  one  ...  #
 *  xxx  year  before  she  goes  to  school  .  #
 *  and  as I  say  I'll  look  into  that  one  in  Monkstown  .  #
 *  it's  just  one  seventy  five  a  day  .  #
 *  watch  you don't  hurt  yourself  on  that  Barbara  #
 *  that  car  it's  put  out  it's  at  church  and I  gets  married  in  it  and  #
 *  she  opens  the  door  .  #
 *  Cathy  I don't know  my  mum  says  you don't  need  to  buy  that  child  #
 *  can  I  have  that  back  please  because  you  are  going to  hurt  yourself  #
 *  oh  show  Cathy  your  new  one  .  #
 *  are you  #
 *  no  they're  not  .  #
 *  I don't  think  so  xxx  .  #
 *  looks  like  a  party  to  me  .  #
 *  Barbara  don't  .  shout  #
 *  he's  what  #
 *  laughs  .  #
 *  Barbara's  that  video  too  .  #
 *  Barbara  #
 *  yes  and  actually  I  didn't  send  for  that  they  just  must  have  sent  me  #
 *  and it  didn't  send  it  back  I  just  .  but  I was  glad  that  I  got  it  #
 *  ah  .  what  was  it  #
 *  what  was  it  .  how  much  was  it  #
 *  well  .  yes  .  #
 *  that was  the  tape  .  #
 *  and  eh  then  I think  you  pay  for  post  and  packaging  too  .  #
 *  but  I don't  think  they're  really  cheaper  but  you  get  six  for  fifty  #
 *  to  start  off  with  .  #
 *  and then  you  haveto  buy  six  .  #
 *  well  that's  me  finished  I've  bought  the  six  now  .  #
 *  uhhuh  .  #
 *  I'll  put  it  on  later  on  .  #
 *  I'm  sure  Cathy's  fed  up  watching  them  .  #
 *  oh  look at  that  one  #
 *  she  got  Barney  and I  got  .  #
 *  where  does  Barney  go  #
 *  to  where  #
 *  what do you call  he  #
 *  no  you  are  not  #
 *  you  do  it  but  .  #
 *  have  you  a  dirty  nappie  Barbara  #
 *  I'll  change  it  in  a wee  minute  .  #
 *  The  Ostrich  .  #
 *  we  read  that  one  night  in  bed  didn't  we  #
 *  no  there's  a  couple  of  them  I  hadn't  heard  of  before  .  #
 *  uhhuh  .  #
 *  Miss  Polly  had  a  dolly  .  #
 *  and  like  Roly  Poly  .  #
 *  uhhuh  .  #
 *  that's right  .  #
 *  well  she  kept  doing  this  Roly  Poly  .  #
 *  laughs  .  #
 *  but  it's  .  it's  what  they're  learning  now  .  #
 *  they  can  xxx  so  .  #
 *  that's  to the  tune  of  Frre  Jacques  .  #
 *  I  actually  I  remembered  Linda  doing  that  one  at  playgroup  .  #
 *  we'll  put  Tilly  in  it  .  #
 *  my  cousin  ...  #
 *  and  Lynn  they  .  Lynn  must  be  forty  .  #
 *  and it  had  a  ball  in  here  with  the  kitchen  and  everything  .  #
 *  it says  I  never  had  any  of  this  when  my  ones  were  growing  #
 *  you  just  touch  it  touch  the  ...  #
 *  do  you see  the  panic  my  mummie  had  on  Christmas  Day  .  #
 *  it was  making  the  dinner  and  that  ...  #
 *  she  thought  Barbara  had  et  ate  them  .  #
 *  she was  in  a  tizzy  .  #

 *  it's  my  friend's  .  #

 *  and  Cathy  for  further  reference  that is  brilliant  #
 *  honestly  she  has  hours  of  fun  with  it  .  #
 *  no  I think  you  haveto  buy  the  doll  .  #
 *  I  never  seen  it  on  its  own  now  .  #
 *  because  she was  going  to get  her  Tiny  Tears  .  #
 *  good  girl  .  #
 *  I'm  glad  to  see  that  she's  beginning  to  talk  to  you  a bit  more  #

 *  is  she  sick  #
 *  well  why  don't you  phone  for  the  doctor  #

 *  she's  been  keeping  them  in  .  #
 *  xxx  .  #
 *  uhhuh  .  #
 *  what's  the  wee  word  #
 *  uhhuh  .  #
 *  well  it  takes  me  to  have  hers  up  because  I  find  when  she's  eating  #
 *  the  way  I  used  to  hers  is  put  some  of  it  up  and  some  of  it  down  .  #
 *  or  even  slides  .  #
 *  she  just  took  slides  out  .  #
 *  they're  out  again  .  #

 *  although  I  can't  ever  see  us  moving  now  .  #
 *  well  I  would  want  a  conservatory  out  the  back  oh it  would  mean  #
 *  well  you see  it's  the  way  the  doors  are  .  #
 *  and then  it  means  the  floor  coming  up  and  all  .  #
 *  uhhuh it  says  let  me  have  a  year  at  least  .  #
 *  right  that's  it  .  you don't  play  with  the  ball  in the  house  .  #
 *  you'll  break  one  of  my  ornaments  .  #
 *  you're  a  bad  girl  .  you're  showing  Cathy  your  true  colors  now  #
 *  there's  Adam's  a good  boy  .  #
 *  I think  they  all  go  through  that  stage  but  .  #
 *  the  girl  I  work  with  Lorraine  .  there's  a  year  between  her  and  #
 *  sometimes  that  wee  girl  doesn't  know  how  to  be  bad  enough  .  #
 *  when  she was  off  there was  one  day  I  said  to  Peter  I'll  swing  for  #
 *  she  has  .  #
 *  I don't know  if  she's  saying  it  an awful lot  but  she's  saying  it  .  #
 *  before  we  ignored  it  and then  before  Easter  she  said  it  and she  will  #
 *  I don't know  where  it  comes  from  but it  doesn't  hear  it  from  me  .  #
 *  I  am  no  angel  but  that's  a  thing  I  just  never  did  use  .  #
 *  she  came  off  with  worse  than  that  Cathy  I'll  tell  you  .  #
 *  I was  sitting  in  my  mummie's  on  New  Year's  Day  and she  came  in  and  #
 *  and  my  mummie  says  what do you  say  there  and I  said  it  #
 *  and it  still  don't  know  to  this  day  where  she  got  that  from  .  #
 *  Kilty  the  dog  .  #
 *  and  for  all  Peter's  faults  that's  not  a  thing  he  uses  in  front  of  #
 *  so  I don't know  where  they  pick  half  the  things  up  .  #
 *  she's  been  told  it's  a  bad  word  and  she's  not  allowed  to  use  it  .  #
 *  well  I'm  glad  you  got  sorted  out  .  keep  taking  your  iron  tablets  #
 *  she  won't  perform  on  demand  .  #
 *  again  I  find  she'll  do  it  when  she  wants  to  do  it  .  #
 *  we  take  her  down  to  Peter's  grannys  and  we  say  wait  to  you see  her  #
 *  look  who's  here  #
 *  this is  Cathy  does  the  speech  .  #
 *  this is  my  sister  in  law  .  #
 *  I'm  just  giving  you  that  .  I  take  it  that's  what  you're  here  for  #
 *  that's  who  she's  like  more  than  anybody  .  #
 *  now  she's  like  my  mummie  but  she's  very  very  like  Andrena  .  #
 *  there's  photographs  of  Andrena  when  it was  a  baby  and  she's  like  #
 *  well  I'm  glad  to  see  her  coming  out of  herself  .  #
 *  she's  like  her  daddy  in  personality  .  she's  very  bubbly  .  I  #
 *  you're not  so  bad  now  but  when  I was  younger  I was  very  shy  Cathy  cause it  #
 *  I've  come  out of  myself  over  the  years  but she  wasn't  always  like  #
 *  Barbara'll  be  the  centre  of  attraction  yes it  would  have  mingled  in  #
 *  I  thought  I was  getting  juice  there  .  #
 *  she  would  go  to the  fridge  herself  and  all  now  .  #
 *  did you  bring  the  chair  in  #
 *  did you want to  sit  down  on  it  #
 *  well  school's  all  finished  isn't  it  #

 *  is that  you  finished  for  the  summer  Cathy  #
 *  and  Katie  #

 *  Katie  Sarah  .  Kathryn  Sarah  and  it'll  get  called  Katie  .  #
 *  Kyle  .  #
 *  we've  decided  on  .  #
 *  they'll  not  take  her  to  next  year  so  they  won't  .  #
 *  I  suppose  I  could  .  #
 *  I  suppose  I  could  shop  around  and  get  her  into  another  playgroup  #
 *  I've  missed  her  when  I've  been  at  work  but it  want  to  keep  her  now  #
 *  now  she'll  still  go  to the  mothers  and  toddlers  on the  Tuesdays  .  #
 *  but  two  days  is  enough  .  #
 *  my  mummie  would  take  her  but  there's  another  one  at  Monkstown  I  #
 *  the  one  in  Monkstown  school  you can  do  that  .  #
 *  yes it  honestly  think  that  that  mother  and  toddlers  down  in  that  #
 *  sorry  Cathy  .  #
 *  there's  people  in  decorating  my  mummie's  house  .  #
 *  she  wanted  this  finished  and  it was  getting  herself  into  a  tizzy  #
 *  nothing  goes  my  mummie's  way  and it  know  this is  going to  annoy  her  #
 *  I'm  dreading  it  .  #
 *  well  at  least  that'll  be  it  over  with  like  .  #
 *  well  one  thing  I'm  still  using  the  nappies  and  everything  else  .  #
 *  you  should  try  her  now  that  she'll  be  running  about  in the  better  #
 *  sure  she  started  last  year  and then  came  out of  it  again  .  #
 *  but  at  least  it  gets  them  used  to  it  .  #
 *  as I  say  I  had  trouble  with  her  and then  she  came  out of  them  no  #
 *  so I  will  not  go  to the  toilet  .  we  don't  know  who  it's  been  #
 *  did  she  run  out  past  you  there  #
 *  lost  her  again  .  #
 *  big  dirty  feet  #
 *  showing  up  her  mummie  .  #
