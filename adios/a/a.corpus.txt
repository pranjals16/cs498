 *  yes .  # 
 *  she's got that she's got an iron and an ironing board funny enough  # 
 *  I'm up from half six this morning doing the ironing .  # 
 *  and you wanna  want to see me ironing   # 
 *  xxx Peter was up from half six so I'm wakened .  # 
 *  I says get up and make me a cup of tea .  # 
 *  so while I was up here's me right  ...  # 
 *  yes yes .  # 
 *  once I'm wakened that's me .  # 
 *  I'm not one that ...  # 
 *  no I couldn't go back over to sleep again .  # 
 *  but we're starting to get her into a bit of a routine going  # 
 *  I've sort of said nine o'clock which I don't think is unreasonable  # 
 *  she'd got into the habit .  # 
 *  one night it was a quarter to one before I could get her off .  # 
 *  no it was too much it was just getting too much far far too much .  # 
 *  apart from anything the two of us were not even getting a  # 
 *  no so we can't do that .  # 
 *  now whether she wants to or not she goes up at nine .  # 
 *  she's in a double bed now .  # 
 *  we have two double beds she doesn't sleep in a single one now you  # 
 *  no I didn't .  # 
 *  I must say once you get her to sleep she wouldn't .  # 
 *  ohmygoodness   # 
 *  once you would get her to sleep she wouldn't waken .  # 
 *  she wouldn't waken or come into you or anything like that .  # 
 *  ah but ...  # 
 *  no we never . the gate whatever it was the top of our stairs must  # 
 *  and it didn't fit .  # 
 *  Peter always meant to get a bit of wood to put down it .  # 
 *  and he never did so eh . just had no need for it really .  # 
 *  uhhuh xxx .  # 
 *  uhhum .  # 
 *  well the bed that we had ...  # 
 *  that's why mine have it at the bottom .  # 
 *  I don't think that Cathy wants to see that .  # 
 *  you just pretend .  # 
 *  her pottie's there .  # 
 *  why don't you put her on the pottie to see if she'll do something  # 
 *  no I must admit it is more my fault than anything cause I'm lazy  # 
 *  that was another thing the health visitor said .  # 
 *  well I says I'm waiting for the better weather coming in .  # 
 *  she's wearing . though . you know the pants that you pull up  # 
 *  but ...  # 
 *  the summer I let her run about the back in the wee toweling  # 
 *  I have a load of them .  # 
 *  is she crying   # 
 *  Barbara cries when she gets her hair brushed you know .  # 
 *  you wouldn't think it sure you wouldn't   # 
 *  see maybe I just don't notice it like you xxx .  # 
 *  uhhuh .  # 
 *  no I probably don't notice it as much .  # 
 *  seems to be fine you know she's ...  # 
 *  she was in the hospital and they took her in you see .  # 
 *  eh . she took an angina attack .  # 
 *  at least they think it was an angina attack .  # 
 *  of course it was a week later before she went in .  # 
 *  will you change her that here   # 
 *  go into your box and get talcum powder . put some on her .  # 
 *  that would be a good idea .  # 
 *  but she'll just haveto take it a bit easier .  # 
 *  well I wouldn't stop it to tell you the truth .  # 
 *  I know .  # 
 *  uhhuh well now I had ...  # 
 *  if I had like . if we had any more .  # 
 *  then I'll haveto give work up .  # 
 *  because neither two of them my mother my mother in law or my mummie  # 
 *  she's too much of a handful to watch another one .  # 
 *  so eh . I .  # 
 *  well the nursery . I was ...  # 
 *  xxx .  # 
 *  do they only take them for a year now but   # 
 *  and you see she's two years to go .  # 
 *  she'll not start school until she's five .  # 
 *  well that one ...  # 
 *  in Monkstown which is where I would haveto try to get her you know  # 
 *  but there is one in the school we're going to look into .  # 
 *  you can send them ...  # 
 *  any day that you want .  # 
 *  Friars Bush I would like her to go to .  # 
 *  we don't have a primary school like Whitehouse do .  # 
 *  now they do have a playschool so they do .  # 
 *  what . Whitehouse or ...  # 
 *  Friar's Bush .  # 
 *  see I even had thought about Whitehouse cause I always liked  # 
 *  my mother in law says Ruth Friar's Bush have a great pass rate for  # 
 *  plus that's where Andrena and Peter they all went there .  # 
 *  so she has a better chance of getting in there xxx .  # 
 *  ah but with my mummie keeping her with playschool I'd haveto ...  # 
 *  well my mother in law is giving up work now so she is .  # 
 *  she works in the Polytech .  # 
 *  so they're getting voluntary redundancy so they are .  # 
 *  well at least she's near pension age anyhow .  # 
 *  so she was one of the ones xxx .  # 
 *  but she got a bit of money out of it so .  # 
 *  and I says you should just take it .  # 
 *  you'll put your day in rightly so you will .  # 
 *  so ...  # 
 *  Alice will be there so they'll be able to take her and bring her  # 
 *  but the play group or playschool now I'm all for going but the  # 
 *  I think we've loads of time .  # 
 *  that wee . see that mothers and toddlers she goes to it's great .  # 
 *  they're great now . now what what she learns .  # 
 *  I was thinking then ...  # 
 *  uhhuh .  # 
 *  well the only one ...  # 
 *  xxx year before she goes to school .  # 
 *  and as I say I'll look into that one in Monkstown .  # 
 *  it's just one seventy five a day .  # 
 *  watch you don't hurt yourself on that Barbara   # 
 *  that car it's put out it's at church and she gets married in it and  # 
 *  she opens the door .  # 
 *  Cathy I don't know my mum says you don't need to buy that child  # 
 *  can I have that back please because you are going to hurt yourself  # 
 *  oh show Cathy your new one .  # 
 *  would you   # 
 *  no they're not .  # 
 *  I don't think so xxx .  # 
 *  looks like a party to me .  # 
 *  Barbara don't . shout   # 
 *  he's what   # 
 *  laughs .  # 
 *  Barbara's that video too .  #

 *  ah . what was it   # 
 *  what was it . how much was it   # 
 *  well . yes .  # 
 *  that was the tape .  # 
 *  and eh then I think you pay for post and packaging too .  # 
 *  but I don't think they're really cheaper but you get six for fifty  # 
 *  to start off with .  # 
 *  and then you haveto buy six .  # 
 *  well that's me finished I've bought the six now .  # 
 *  uhhuh .  #

 *  well I don't have a highchair . but if I don't get the lend of  # 
 *  a girl out of work borrowed the wee car seat you know the one with  # 
 *  ohmygoodness   # 
 *  it was my aunt . she has a wee charity . well she helps run a  #

 *  now there's a couple of wee favorite things I lent a girl but  # 
 *  pull your trousers up .  # 
 *  am I a sillybilly   # 
 *  that was mine .  # 
 *  my mummie got new hair put into it and new eyes when she was born  # 
 *  and the hair's off it   # 
 *  they didn't stick it on right . I haveto get it stuck on right   # 
 *  of course she picked it up by the hair .  # 
 *  ohmygoodness clean it up quick   # 
 *  oh I'm sure Cathy doesn't want to see that   # 
 *  she's a bold girl   # 
 *  and I see she's the face ...  #

 *  I don't want it .  # 
 *  my cousin's got all of my stuff . all intact   # 
 *  there wasn't a mark on them . but this one ...  # 
 *  put her nappie on now .  # 
 *  do you want to get one out of the box and put it on   # 
 *  you don't play with any balls in the house .  # 
 *  no you don't .  # 
 *  no you don't .  # 
 *  didn't I smack Tiny for that   # 
 *  that's dirty .  # 
 *  tell her to shush and stop crying .  # 
 *  there you go . that's round the wrong way .  # 
 *  I'll not be able to turn my head . she'll just go and pick it up  # 
 *  no I'll do it  . I can just hear her .  # 
 *  but it'll progress like cause before she just said we'll just send  # 
 *  look at your hair   # 
 *  Cathy says would you go up and do a wee bit of work in her house .  # 
 *  Cathy has one of the houses up past the graveyard isn't it   # 
 *  xx xx .  # 
 *  just right .  # 
 *  yes .  # 
 *  do you know what there is out there   # 
 *  a parquet floor and he's spilt paint over it and everything .  # 
 *  just in the hall there . he says it's xxx xx xx plus what put him  # 
 *  we talked about putting a conservatory on the back .  # 
 *  Cathy what annoys me is doing all this work . see if we ever  # 
 *  although I can't ever see us moving now .  # 
 *  well I would want a conservatory out the back but it would mean  # 
 *  well you see it's the way the doors are .  # 
 *  and then it means the floor coming up and all .  # 
 *  so I says let me have a year at least  .  # 
 *  right that's it . you don't play with the ball in the house .  # 
 *  you'll break one of my ornaments .  # 
 *  you're a bad girl . you're showing Cathy your true colors now   # 
 *  there's Adam's a good boy .  # 
 *  I think they all go through that stage but .  # 
 *  the girl I work with Lorraine . there's a year between her and  # 
 *  sometimes that wee girl doesn't know how to be bad enough .  # 
 *  when I was off there was one day I said to Peter I'll swing for  # 
 *  she has .  # 
 *  I don't know if she's saying it an awful lot but she's saying it .  # 
 *  before we ignored it and then before Easter she said it and I will  # 
 *  I don't know where it comes from but she doesn't hear it from me .  # 
 *  I am no angel but that's a thing I just never did use .  # 
 *  she came off with worse than that Cathy I'll tell you .  # 
 *  I was sitting in my mummie's on New Year's Day and she came in and  # 
 *  and my mummie says  what did you say there  and she said it  # 
 *  and I still don't know to this day where she got that from .  # 
 *  Kilty the dog .  # 
 *  and for all Peter's faults that's not a thing he uses in front of  # 
 *  so I don't know where they pick half the things up .  # 
 *  she's been told it's a bad word and she's not allowed to use it .  # 
 *  well I'm glad you got sorted out . keep taking your iron tablets  # 
 *  she won't perform on demand .  # 
 *  again I find she'll do it when she wants to do it .  # 
 *  we take her down to Peter's grannys and we say wait to you see her  # 
 *  look who's here   # 
 *  this is Cathy does the speech .  # 
 *  this is my sister in law .  # 
 *  I'm just giving you that . I take it that's what you're here for  # 
 *  that's who she's like more than anybody .  # 
 *  now she's like my mummie but she's very very like Andrena .  # 
 *  there's photographs of Andrena when she was a baby and she's like  # 
 *  well I'm glad to see her coming out of herself .  # 
 *  she's like her daddy in personality . she's very bubbly . I  # 
 *  I'm not so bad now but when I was younger I was very shy Cathy so I  # 
 *  I've come out of myself over the years but I wasn't always like  # 
 *  Barbara'll be the centre of attraction but I would have mingled in  # 
 *  I thought she was getting juice there .  # 
 *  she would go to the fridge herself and all now .  # 
 *  did you bring the chair in   # 
 *  do you want to sit down on it   # 
 *  well school's all finished isn't it   # 
 *  isn't school all finished   # 
 *  is that you finished for the summer Cathy   # 
 *  and Katie   # 
 *  what are we going to call our new baby if it's a wee girl   # 
 *  Katie Sarah . Kathryn Sarah and it'll get called Katie .  # 
 *  Kyle .  # 
 *  we've decided on .  # 
 *  they'll not take her to next year so they won't .  # 
 *  I suppose I could .  # 
 *  I suppose I could shop around and get her into another playgroup  # 
 *  I've missed her when I've been at work so I want to keep her now  # 
 *  now she'll still go to the mothers and toddlers on the Tuesdays .  # 
 *  but two days is enough .  # 
 *  my mummie would take her but there's another one at Monkstown I  # 
 *  the one in Monkstown school you can do that .  # 
 *  but I honestly think that that mother and toddlers down in that  # 
 *  sorry Cathy .  # 
 *  there's people in decorating my mummie's house .  # 
 *  she wanted this finished and she was getting herself into a tizzy  # 
 *  nothing goes my mummie's way and I know this is going to annoy her  # 
 *  I'm dreading it .  # 
 *  well at least that'll be it over with like .  # 
 *  well one thing I'm still using the nappies and everything else .  # 
 *  you should try her now that she'll be running about in the better  # 
 *  sure she started last year and then came out of it again .  # 
 *  but at least it gets them used to it .  # 
 *  as I say I had trouble with her and then she came out of them no  # 
 *  but she will not go to the toilet . we don't know who it's been  # 
 *  did she run out past you there   # 
 *  lost her again .  #

 *  Cathy you know . but there's no way I . would cripple me .  # 
 *  I wouldn't .  # 
 *  because I wouldn't even be able to go and out and get new carpet  #

 *  I says no Peter just leave it for another wee while .  #

 *  and then there was another he had . a Norwich Union ...  # 
 *  different policy . now he just . it was a very small policy .  # 
 *  it was to do when . it's a trivial like . it's only about five  # 
 *  three hundred of them .  #

 *  we got two hundred . if we had . Peter hadn't ev  have used  # 
 *  and eh . the week before he had lifted a hundred pound out to pay  # 
 *  I says they sent you enough letters out you didn't read them .  # 
 *  em . but we got . our mortgage is through them . so we got  # 
 *  fifteen hundred . it's not to be laughed at having said that .  # 
 *  between the two of them they'll see us through . like it'll pay  # 
 *  we'll not be able to do an awful lot . but we'll eat .  # 
 *  we'll be able to pay bills .  # 
 *  and then come September like . once it breaks again then we're  # 
 *  and then he'll be up to his eyes again . you know . but eh  # 
 *  and . I just can't go out to work with the two of them .  # 
 *  it's impossible .  # 
 *  ah ah   #

 *  I says have you nothing cheaper than that  I says .  #

 *  and then at night time we had . me and Tom had spare ribs and  #

 *  that's what I'm saying it's ...  # 
 *  like we've been away stacks of times before and I've never seen  # 
 *  but I mean we've seen Salou so I don't think we would go back now  # 
 *  although we enjoyed it  and I mean I would recommend to anyone  # 
 *  that's what I'm saying but it's . well it's a lot of money to get  # 
 *  I mean it cost us eleven hundred to go and then your spending money  # 
 *  and then yours would be more . see we weren't paying for Ethan  # 
 *  oh I enjoy my holiday every year .  #

 *  not really . his lightened .  # 
 *  xxx .  # 
 *  all her  curls is going out .  # 
 *  see that was me .  # 
 *  I was . I had curly . hair when I was her age too you see .  # 
 *  so did you have a good time in Ballycastle   # 
 *  that's what I'm saying when you think of the money you spend here  # 
 *  you're not getting them for you rip them .  # 
 *  he did . I'd only put them into the thing and he pulled them all  # 
 *  no Ethan you ripped them   # 
 *  see the way it's starting actually come out at the top . he  # 
 *  uhhuh they just get a wee bit . they stick cardboard in her hair  # 
 *  he's  he has a board with all the different colors .  # 
 *  yes that's all wound round that's what I'm saying it takes them a  # 
 *  goes by the length of their hair .  # 
 *  the wee girl before her had long hair and all the way down her back  # 
 *  but so it goes by the length of their hair what they charge so that  # 
 *  uhhuh roll on September .  # 
 *  you do . . there's ones out of the other nursery going you see  # 
 *  and the wee girl across the road's going .  # 
 *  the only thing is they st they only do an hour .  # 
 *  and it's they do it in two stages .  # 
 *  they're starting the first lot at half nine to half ten and then  # 
 *  I think it just depends how they get on .  # 
 *  and then they increase it I think by half and hour just gradually  # 
 *  I mean they start the dinners in the last week of September so  # 
 *  nine to half one five days .  # 
 *  the first day you haveto stay with them no matter what you haveto  # 
 *  I'll haveto .  #

 *  Amber her cousin was here and everything was upstairs cause they  # 
 *  four and a half .  # 
 *  what are you going to get   # 
 *  some toys right .  # 
 *  there's your house .  # 
 *  I wonder where it is .  # 
 *  it is quite tricky actually .  # 
 *  she got that last Christmas . I think this year it'll be easier  # 
 *  well come on let's go . sorry . she needs to go to the toilet .  # 
 *  are you holding on to the last minute again missy   # 
 *  yeah .  # 
 *  March .  # 
 *  I did . two weeks and she was out of them .  # 
 *  she was twenty months .  # 
 *  I swear to God .  # 
 *  I had been thinking about it cause we were going away on our  # 
 *  first of all . nothing and then she went to go and like I didn't  # 
 *  yes she had a few accidents at the beginning but not bad you know  # 
 *  now she runs to the toilet quite a lot because she drinks an awful  # 
 *  yeah .  # 
 *  I bought a sheet to put down and she wet the bed . a few times  # 
 *  she tossed and turned during the night and I wondered if that was it  # 
 *  there is there's another one .  # 
 *  she's going to show me up aren't you   # 
 *  so I lifted her like during the night and she was half sleeping and  # 
 *  I was going like what  but it just happened . don't ask me how  # 
 *  it was March and by the end of March and April she was totally out  # 
 *  and everybody kept going on about it at the time and they were  # 
 *  here's me it didn't even come in to it   cause I went round to  # 
 *  and I don't know how it happened and I thought about it and I said  # 
 *  well she's capable .  # 
 *  aye she is for her age .  # 
 *  even like a wee tiny baby . we did now like with it being the  # 
 *  that's the way she was born like isn't it   # 
 *  I know cause I just thought and then when it happened I just  # 
 *  sure everybody told me it's a nightmare .  # 
 *  the only thing I find with her now is . I forgot about it was you  # 
 *  but then it just passed as quick as it appeared .  # 
 *  you haven't finished that one .  # 
 *  you don't like that one . that one's the same .  # 
 *  no . you're a rat .  # 
 *  eating all this rubbish .  # 
 *  don't be silly   # 
 *  she'll still have her lunch won't you   # 
 *  I think it's just to see if this one's the same as that one .  # 
 *  I suppose if I did have another one and it was bad I'd know what  # 
 *  but Mike's sister Glenda says that's the way I done it  but  # 
 *  show Cathy all the colors .  # 
 *  there's the xx in the house looking out the window .  # 
 *  she can be destructful  destructive  too sometimes but not  # 
 *  and it's probably her daddy . a bit of rough play and she's just  # 
 *  I don't know where that key is . there's it down there .  # 
 *  aye when somebody comes in .  # 
 *  her best time is nighttime when she's just chatting away .  # 
 *  have we . I can't think . we have somewhere . we usually see  # 
 *  aye she sings in the mike and all with that there so she probably  # 
 *  she waffles away at night something terrible you know and you know  # 
 *  your head is away with her she never shuts up .  # 
 *  she goes in to this wee fantasy world and it's really really funny  # 
 *  was she talking a wee bit better today   # 
 *  is Cathy going to pack up all her books   # 
 *  and we're going to the shops aren't we Mich   #

 *  it's not too bad .  # 
 *  aye sure over a while .  # 
 *  I'll keep it out of Mike's way cause he's liable to think it's his  #

 *  I can't do the both so I've been phoning up and saying .  # 
 *  all I'd need now is Nicola to move away or her dad change jobs and  # 
 *  that would change all my plans .  # 
 *  aye that's right or get another child .  # 
 *  he's not in a permanent job and they're not in a permanent house  #

 *  I don't care .  # 
 *  as long as like I get some sleep and she's in there .  # 
 *  and I know the longer it goes on then the less she'll come in and  # 
 *  and then .  # 
 *  she's looking forward to going into her own bedroom .  # 
 *  aye .  # 
 *  och I know .  #

 *  Michelle knows what it is .  # 
 *  don't you   # 
 *  what's in mummie's tummy   # 
 *  and what do you call him   # 
 *  don't know   # 
 *  aye .  # 
 *  I do know what it is .  # 
 *  mm .  # 
 *  she was there when they told her .  # 
 *  all though sometimes she'll say it's a girl .  # 
 *  so she would .  # 
 *  aye .  # 
 *  it's a boy .  # 
 *  mm it's mad .  # 
 *  oh no .  # 
 *  she was mad enough .  # 
 *  I want a wee calm one .  # 
 *  I know she is right enough .  # 
 *  she's not like a wee hyperactive or anything .  # 
 *  or a wee loopy .  # 
 *  she's dead on .  # 
 *  she's quite calm .  # 
 *  she was like she was a hard baby .  # 
 *  the first year was an nightmare like but .  # 
 *  cause she was colicy and windy and had like xxx .  # 
 *  very clingy and .  # 
 *  yeh .  # 
 *  right .  # 
 *  cupboards .  # 
 *  do you know that she was never that bad .  # 
 *  do you know this .  # 
 *  now she never touched that tv video hifi . nothing .  # 
 *  we never moved anything .  # 
 *  she never broke .  # 
 *  when she was a wee girl and on her feet going about here in her wee  # 
 *  you know that wee walky thing .  # 
 *  she never touched anything .  # 
 *  honest to God .  # 
 *  even when she was crawling she wouldn't have touched anything .  # 
 *  I'm just realizing now that she didn't .  # 
 *  because our friends my sister my husbands sister .  # 
 *  your first .  # 
 *  cause their their wee one is ten months and is crawling and is  # 
 *  and they're constantly pulling her xxx .  # 
 *  and I'm thinking she didn't .  # 
 *  and she's breaking things .  # 
 *  and she's over poking her hands in the video and all .  # 
 *  and they're all sure did Michelle not do that  .  # 
 *  not really .  # 
 *  I suppose a bit .  # 
 *  but not really .  # 
 *  she was all right .  # 
 *  so he from .  # 
 *  she from .  # 
 *  as I say from .  # 
 *  from eighteen months she's like she's been a great wee girl .  # 
 *  and from two she's been better again .  # 
 *  but they say sometimes that you know .  # 
 *  bad baby and you get a good toddler .  # 
 *  cause like wee Laura .  # 
 *  when she was a baby was great .  # 
 *  but see now from .  # 
 *  she's getting more mobile she's a monster .  # 
 *  she's just .  # 
 *  their heads are turned .  # 
 *  she does this thing where she .  # 
 *  if they put away and say no .  # 
 *  she'll throw herself on the ground .  # 
 *  throw her head back and cry and all .  # 
 *  but she .  # 
 *  I don't remember her doing that .  # 
 *  cause you know .  # 
 *  but Laura was a great baby and slept and took her food and .  # 
 *  and sleeps in her cot .  # 
 *  you know that way .  # 
 *  where as she was a nightmare that way .  # 
 *  she never slept in her cot cried at night .  # 
 *  up at night .  # 
 *  cried when anyone .  # 
 *  wouldn't take her bottle .  # 
 *  boked her bottle .  # 
 *  was a terrible baby .  # 
 *  but yet was great .  # 
 *  whereas Laura was the opposite .  # 
 *  you know .  # 
 *  work .  # 
 *  I know .  # 
 *  from experience and all .  # 
 *  right .  # 
 *  yeh .  # 
 *  aye .  # 
 *  I know .  # 
 *  they're horrible .  # 
 *  I know .  # 
 *  they xxx .  # 
 *  I can imagine they're totally different .  # 
 *  whereas wee girls do . I mean she would just sit for an hour like  # 
 *  the wee boy Alan next door that was born at the same time as her  # 
 *  that's all right love . did you have a wee accident   # 
 *  where's your cup that it was in anyway   # 
 *  you put it in that cup and it spilled . all right . try again .  # 
 *  right that's enough then is it   # 
 *  there you go . a wee accident . have you had enough   # 
 *  well put it down .  # 
 *  all right do it yourself . I couldn't be annoyed anymore .  # 
 *  arguing and ...  # 
 *  mhm .  # 
 *  I just says at this stage do you know what it is    # 
 *  she says aye well like it would be formed . a girl or a boy  # 
 *  she says I'll see what way it's lying  .  # 
 *  at twenty or was it twenty two weeks   # 
 *  it was about ten . oh gosh I'm all mixed up . when was it   # 
 *  when you're about eighteen or twenty weeks . you know that   # 
 *  and Mike was with me and she was there and I sort of expected her  # 
 *  I expected her to say that   # 
 *  and she says I'll see what way it's lying  .  # 
 *  and she just scanned around to see what way it's lying and she sort  # 
 *  aye . well she says now the cord's there  .  # 
 *  so she tried to move it a bit and it just moved so that's its wee  # 
 *  no I didn't mean for Mike to find out really and I was like . oh  # 
 *  and then she moved it and I says it's a boy  and he was okay  # 
 *  I know I've been buying things and all . you know wee boy things  # 
 *  I hope people don't think I'm going to be annoyed cause I was quite  # 
 *  but I'm looking forward to it . it'll be a wee challenge having a  #

 *  I was getting them every few minutes .  # 
 *  and then they come back again at about ten or eleven .  # 
 *  and they were getting sort of stronger .  # 
 *  and it must have been about midnight or so .  # 
 *  they were saying to me .  # 
 *  try and get some sleep and all .  # 
 *  but I couldn't cause they were getting a lot stronger and I knew  # 
 *  so I think I went down to them then . you know down to the  #

 *  and they were real strong like and I could hardly do my breathing  # 
 *  you know they were really strong .  # 
 *  but you know she was like .  # 
 *  they're not really strong and they're only fifteen minutes apart  # 
 *  but then the was one on top of each other and then they were really  # 
 *  and I started shaking and all and she says .  # 
 *  are you nervous   # 
 *  but I couldn't stop myself but apparently I was in shock a wee bit  # 
 *  and then I pranced about the ward and I was in and out of the  # 
 *  and they were getting really strong and I was sitting up and  # 
 *  so I kept on thinking and then the next one I was in real agony .  # 
 *  I just couldn't talk or nothing and then luckily enough the wee  # 
 *  two Paracodol .  # 
 *  and the wee girl in the bed beside me says .  #

 *  he wasn't with me at all .  # 
 *  they got me down to the labor ward and got me onto the table when  # 
 *  so they stuck a drip in then cause my contractions went away again  # 
 *  so I phoned him then .  # 
 *  aye   # 
 *  no I went and got my bath and went down to the ward .  # 
 *  well by the time I got back from my bath and my tea and toast and  #

 *  and he says to me .  # 
 *  I noticed you . you never stop kissing and hugging him .  #

 *  it's red .  # 
 *  she's had one before and um she happened to be telling her health  # 
 *  so she said she thought it would be good for the kids but she loved  # 
 *  she's one of those weird ones that just loves animals you know  # 
 *  well it's not too bad I touched it like but I wouldn't have one as  # 
 *  the kids love it though .  # 
 *  she's two boys at four and five .  # 
 *  and they think it's great .  # 
 *  yeah  yeah  it's use I think she really likes it for herself  # 
 *  you know .  #

 *  she said  laughs .  # 
 *  right now this is the first one here Rachel isn't it   # 
 *  now you're putting the shopping into the duck pond .  # 
 *  that wouldn't be right sure it wouldn't   # 
 *  Rachel try this one first . that's where they go to buy their  # 
 *  there's the shoe rack and there's the wee girl trying her shoes on  # 
 *  no I'm not really into animals are you   # 
 *  yeah I know you don't really want to deprive them of having pets  # 
 *  but if you looks at a hamster or snake you couldn't get much love  # 
 *  I know I know . well I was thinking about .  # 
 *  a rabbit .  # 
 *  maybe it would be like a good a lazy enough pet .  # 
 *  so the guy next door he's into animals and he said not really it's  # 
 *  I know I know .  # 
 *  that's right .  # 
 *  no I'm having a . though Peter would really like to have a dog  # 
 *  that's right I know and that's a .. sure what would you do I mean  # 
 *  you not talking Rachel   # 
 *  no Rachel has .  # 
 *  her Granny and Granda took her .  # 
 *  no she was quite young at the time .  # 
 *  so I'm looking forward to going to it myself taking her . taking  # 
 *  did they   # 
 *  are you going away anywhere for holidays this year   # 
 *  oh yeah   # 
 *  right .  # 
 *  no we've nothing planned this year right ...  # 
 *  last year we ended up going to the Highlands in September .  # 
 *  but we'd really love to go away somewhere this year really .  # 
 *  I'd love to go abroad I think .  # 
 *  my sister is going to Greece this year so that has sort of put me  # 
 *  so she's she's they're off to Rhodes and it looks lovely .  # 
 *  yes it really put me in the notion to go somewhere .  # 
 *  but there's no way . we couldn't afford it .  # 
 *  I know I know .  # 
 *  but I don't know if I'd really fancy going away being pregnant .  # 
 *  you don't just feel one hundred per cent .  # 
 *  yes but normally I don't have the urge to go abroad at all .  # 
 *  you know anywhere would . a weekend in Enniskillen would be great  # 
 *  because you know this year for some reason I do .  # 
 *  oh it's terrific . it's different .  # 
 *  och yes I am I'm just glad it's all done and ...  # 
 *  all ready for summer now .  # 
 *  well do you see we were going to move . but then we decided not  # 
 *  my brother in law .  # 
 *  my brother in law did it for us so he did . so he's pretty  # 
 *  well Peter he could . he would normally do it .  # 
 *  but he just hasn't got any time you know .  # 
 *  uhhuh .  # 
 *  uhhuh it's just um different courses and that .  # 
 *  I think his firm's actually you know based you know . in the main  # 
 *  so that's why ...  # 
 *  uhhuh .  # 
 *  it is .  # 
 *  it's awful . it's a real nightmare .  # 
 *  I wouldn't have minded if we hadn't have had the builders in . we  # 
 *  yeah yeah we got a new fireplace put in aswell .  # 
 *  that's because she has been awake from before seven o'clock this  # 
 *  yes she's doing that every morning now .  # 
 *  uhhuh .  # 
 *  well I'm not too bad actually .  # 
 *  I go to my bed at nine o'clock every day anyhow . but it doesn't  # 
 *  I don't get up until half eight like so she's fine . from seven  # 
 *  watches tv .  # 
 *  do you ever see doctors in Casualty with one of them on Rachel   # 
 *  just like the doctors in Casualty do . don't they   # 
 *  right .  # 
 *  is that right   # 
 *  um I think he will probably just get the days really . he  # 
 *  um we sort haveto stay because I want him to take Christmas . to  # 
 *  the seventeenth uhhuh .  # 
 *  so he will haveto take time off work whenever I am actually in the  # 
 *  so he'll haveto save as much as possible until then .  # 
 *  no just the first one . just the mini one . but I haven't had  # 
 *  yes you do .  # 
 *  yes .  # 
 *  they give you a big scan and you can have a photo .  # 
 *  but yes I had one at twelve or eleven weeks last week .  # 
 *  that's right I know it looks like a baby . yeah it's exciting .  # 
 *  yeah I really believe that there's only one there .  # 
 *  because Peter's daddy's a twin and I always thought you know with  # 
 *  I thought oh no I hope it's not twins .  # 
 *  twins are lovely but I wouldn't like to look after them .  # 
 *  I wouldn't even mind the first time . but definitely not when  # 
 *  and you're only planning on having one more .  # 
 *  I feel sorry for her .  # 
 *  yeah .  # 
 *  the first couple of months can be terrible . getting up to feed  # 
 *  the Ulster . yeah uhhuh it's good . they're nice they're really  # 
 *  yes .  # 
 *  no no different . even when I went with Rachel the first time you  # 
 *  though you're under a particular consultant but I don't think . I  # 
 *  um but this doctor I had this time was really really nice . you  # 
 *  I would really like to see him again . he was very good .  # 
 *  he reckons I had a Caesarean Section with Rachel .  # 
 *  because she was breach . eh though he reckons I have a seventy  # 
 *  because it was just a Caesarean Section . though I'm wondering  # 
 *  I mean they couldn't tell . but those nurses must be able to tell  # 
 *  but every time they felt my stomach they said I'm not convinced  # 
 *  and they actually had to give me a scan the morning of the section  # 
 *  I think it might have been transferred to lying across that way .  # 
 *  but they said in the hospital that they didn't know that they'd  # 
 *  I thought maybe when they did the section maybe they would have  # 
 *  och that's right that's right I know it might just have been a  # 
 *  it probably was . but just a just a that she was in a weird  # 
 *  I just wondered .  # 
 *  well they were waiting until I went into labor . but I didn't go  # 
 *  yes yes .  # 
 *  now I don't think I would do that the next time .  # 
 *  it was horrible going under .  # 
 *  you see I thought . I'd had an operation a couple of years ago  # 
 *  you were sort of happy as Larry . you don't care what happens you  # 
 *  and you were actually in the theater without any premed .  # 
 *  it was terrible . I had to close my eyes the whole time and even  # 
 *  and I shaked my head I couldn't open my eyes  laughs .  # 
 *  and see everyone with their greens on and their xxx equipment ...  # 
 *  and then when they do put . now I read beforehand about having a  # 
 *  it sounds awful  laughs . you imagine the size of a balloon  # 
 *  what actually happens once you breathe suddenly in and it might  # 
 *  you don't even notice you're breathing in the oxygen . but then  # 
 *  and you feel your whole body going numb ...  # 
 *  and the last thing I felt going numb was my mouth ...  # 
 *  and then you just seen the blackness . oh that was horrible   # 
 *  that's why I wouldn't go under that anaesthetic again .  # 
 *  it was horrible it really was .  # 
 *  he . he waited in a room there .  # 
 *  next door because they don't let you in if they're doing a general  # 
 *  he could of come in .  # 
 *  so I says if I did haveto have a Caesarean the next time I would  # 
 *  because em I mean you're not giddy or anything when you come round  # 
 *  you know   # 
 *  apparently you can feel a bit of wetness when the water breaks and  # 
 *  my cousin said it felt like someone was washing their hands in her  # 
 *  but she was xxx xxx xxx and they usually have that xxx was breach  # 
 *  and then they said it was maybe alright and they tried turning ...  # 
 *  they tried turning . apparently they don't do that now ...  # 
 *  but they says because I was Rhesus negative that they don't do that  # 
 *  and the baby was positive so that the blood crosses or something  # 
 *  no it's um ah an injection of um AntiD whatever that is just after  # 
 *  then ...  # 
 *  she did the last time but it's too long to wait . but she will  # 
 *  you're very quiet today Flossy .  # 
 *  did she Rose   # 
 *  you see I thought it was a good idea have a section this time  # 
 *  and I get over operations really quickly . and I thought this  # 
 *  cause even the doctor in hospital says to me with a bit of luck it  # 
 *  I think he thought I was crazy but they . I knew why afterwards  # 
 *  it was awful especially when everyone else was getting out of bed  # 
 *  but I couldn't really jump out and feed and change Rachel for a  # 
 *  I had to get . the nurses to come and do that .  # 
 *  and with your first baby it's a bit of a shock after about the  # 
 *  your first attempt at trying to change a nappie after about three  # 
 *  what   # 
 *  naw she was a terrible baby she was . I called her a live wire .  # 
 *  I didn't want to say she was a terrible baby a live wire seemed  # 
 *  she did nothing but cry for the first couple of months .  # 
 *  no matter what I did though . I really don't think there was  # 
 *  I think she would have been like that no matter what ...  # 
 *  because my mum tried to tell me that she wasn't getting enough food  # 
 *  not getting enough food . and my aunt tried to tell me she had  # 
 *  even when I lifted her up you know .  # 
 *  it really wears you down doesn't it   # 
 *  so she could nurse him .  # 
 *  well that's ...  # 
 *  xxx too .  # 
 *  she did just want to be nursed the whole time .  # 
 *  really .  # 
 *  and when I put her down at all it was terrible . and then I says  # 
 *  at least maybe you could get the dishes done . make the beds .  # 
 *  but maybe this one will not need that .  # 
 *  I didn't actually have one with Rachel .  # 
 *  by the time I sort of thought about it it was you know . it was  # 
 *  and another thing that I could have did with was something that  # 
 *  because I spent ages rocking her down .  # 
 *  wait to see where they go Rachel .  # 
 *  I think that pair goes in there .  # 
 *  mummie puts a wee thing on your head to take your temperature  # 
 *  they seem to be okay .  # 
 *  uhhuh .  # 
 *  that's right .  # 
 *  sometimes I know you really just use it to confirm it don't you .  # 
 *  I think we need your hair cut again Rachel .  # 
 *  it looks very long .  # 
 *  well that's okay .  # 
 *  well I was actually supposed to do my test tomorrow .  # 
 *  I got a letter last week .  # 
 *  and I thought it was a good idea at first because it was before the  # 
 *  uhhuh she . then I thought about it and I thought oh no    # 
 *  I was so ill last week . Thursday and Friday was really bad . I  # 
 *  so I thought it would be better cancelling it than sort of throwing  # 
 *  up to scratch .  # 
 *  so I'll just leave it for a couple of months ...  # 
 *  until I get enthusiastic about it again . there's no sense in  # 
 *  I got an exam in Tech next week again .  # 
 *  yes I have just about .  # 
 *  it's the second part of the ...  # 
 *  I think I did okay on the first part .  # 
 *  I still haven't heard any results back though . I don't think  # 
 *  but if I scrape a pass though I don't care .  # 
 *  right now you put down one on top of Rose's .  # 
 *  ach look   # 
 *  you're not getting a computer Rachel .  # 
 *  a paddling pool .  # 
 *  and tots tv films .  # 
 *  that will be good won't it   # 
 *  no .  # 
 *  not yet it's going to be a surprise .  # 
 *  and granny's getting you a birthday cake isn't she Rachel   # 
 *  what kind of birthday cake   # 
 *  what is it   # 
 *  is it not a Sooty one   # 
 *  who's douchac    # 
 *  who's douchac    # 
 *  douchac off the tv   # 
 *  take that out of your mouth .  #

 *  we looked everywhere and it had to be one of the library books that  # 
 *  oh I think I might have . I mean I do remember seeing it upstairs  # 
 *  there you go .  # 
 *  what's that Rachel   #

 *  chicken Korma or something but he hasn't actually bothered and by  # 
 *  no what are you going to eat for your birthday   #

 *  you know there's so many places I mean that don't cater for  # 
 *  well when Rachel was a bit younger and wouldn't really settle and  # 
 *  yes but that's right I remember seeing it on tv . I think it was  # 
 *  Rachel wait to you see this .  #

 *  what do you say Rachel   #

 *  so they're just moving on the week that we're getting married .  # 
 *  do you know down there at Firmount   #

 *  no it's long .  # 
 *  it's way down past your knees isn't it   # 
 *  no blue darling .  #

 *  though the thing about it was with short sleeves and the top of  # 
 *  and the top it just flows away down to my ankles .  # 
 *  it's full length . and I got a pair of those wee boots . you  # 
 *  and the dress just sits on top of those .  #

 *  two years ago or three years it must be three years four years ago  # 
 *  I mean it was only a registry office wedding aswell . but you  # 
 *  I ended up with a skirt and a long shirt over it . I really did I  # 
 *  aye even for trying to get normal clothes never mind something to  # 
 *  no I went to quite a few places you know with them having the  # 
 *  and a lot of rubbish really .  # 
 *  but if I hadn't of ...  # 
 *  you know that shop Monsoon where Anderson and McCauley's used to be  # 
 *  that's a beautiful . there's some beautiful things in there .  # 
 *  I mean there was loads of things that I could ev  have had if I  # 
 *  there was some gorgeous things . but . I couldn't find anything  # 
 *  but . I finally got that dress in Wallis . which I was quite  # 
 *  because I would have maybe thought of getting something made .  # 
 *  though it is quite weddingy looking .  # 
 *  that's right .  # 
 *  you can still get away with the summery things .  # 
 *  oh no not a professional photographer . we couldn't afford it .  # 
 *  so just snaps will do . that's what my sister did aswell .  # 
 *  just got the best ones blown up .  # 
 *  yeah .  # 
 *  I know that's true .  # 
 *  I know .  # 
 *  I know when I went to pay for the deposit for the reception aswell  # 
 *  no and I really did want that hotel because my sister and my friend  # 
 *  and it's very good value for money .  # 
 *  three o'clock we're getting married at .  # 
 *  drag out the whole day really you know . so the reception is  # 
 *  no not really it's just my mum and my sister and her husband and my  # 
 *  there's only going to be about twenty twenty two people there .  # 
 *  because I don't want any fuss you know I don't . even if I had  # 
 *  uhhuh Rachel's got a boy hasn't she   # 
 *  and aren't you going to get some flowers in a basket   # 
 *  I know I know .  # 
 *  will I go and show Rose the wee brochure about the scary monsters   # 
 *  you stay there and I'll go and get the wee book .  # 
 *  okay darling .  # 
 *  there's it there .  # 
 *  tell Rose . did you you and Daddy didn't go in it sure you didn't  # 
 *  why not   # 
 *  you were scared .  # 
 *  so Mummy went in and Mummy got really frightened . because Mummy  # 
 *  it was too scary .  # 
 *  and she was absolutely fascinated . because she heard me telling  # 
 *  she's really thrilled by it .  # 
 *  wasn't it like a cave Rachel . it was all dark . and you come  # 
 *  and you really didn't want to stay . so your Daddy took you out  # 
 *  it was like sort of ten o'clock in the morning . xxx just up .  # 
 *  Rachel . and get the wee pictures that Mummy was to take to show  # 
 *  sitting on the settee .  # 
 *  it's . the highland mystery world . it's ...  # 
 *  it's . this was the first summer it's been opened .  # 
 *  ah it's quite good . it's quite interesting .  # 
 *  they were em ...  # 
 *  that's Rachel that's Rachel .  # 
 *  and it's in the school . it's in the school isn't it Rachel   # 
 *  and Barnardos are running this thing over in Tullycarn Primary  # 
 *  it's a permanent thing . they've moved two classrooms into a  # 
 *  it's supposed to sort of teach children . to teach their children  # 
 *  and it's really well equipped . I mean there's been thousands  # 
 *  and it's not being used . no we've been the only ones there this  # 
 *  it's all in the mornings . apparently it's busier in the mornings  # 
 *  but I couldn't make it in the mornings . I go over a couple of  # 
 *  but this last three times I've been over there's just been Rachel  # 
 *  and on one occasion there was just another girl with her two  # 
 *  now before the holidays it seemed to be pretty busy .  # 
 *  but it's really died down .  # 
 *  of course ach it's wild . and my friend she just graduated from  # 
 *  with a diploma in Community and Youth .  # 
 *  and she was lucky enough to get a job in there ...  # 
 *  and she's really delighted . but their hours have all been cut  # 
 *  because there's supposed to be like two there per session . but  # 
 *  yes it is . you see that was the funny thing . my mum goes to  # 
 *  and my mummie says I wonder do they know about the centre .  # 
 *  xxx .  # 
 *  yeah I said that aswell . like I mean if it was somewhere where  # 
 *  well they do yes they do . they do up to em P seven .  # 
 *  yes there's a different room for the P sevens to do different sorts  # 
 *  they cater from babies onwards .  # 
 *  I mean there's a lot of activity toys for babies to play with and  # 
 *  and they're all brand spanking new . not like our Toddlers .  # 
 *  it's like the Early Learning Centre the one ...  # 
 *  but ...  # 
 *  well . no I think you're actually supposed to do things with your  # 
 *  that's what you're supposed to do . there's now there's another  # 
 *  and she . she . is . well that's what they're supposed to do  # 
 *  but no one's ever really sort of said you know . sort of guided  # 
 *  I mean ...  # 
 *  yes we did .  # 
 *  yes yes that sort of thing yes yes yes .  # 
 *  it's great . it really is . but now I'm afraid if it's not  # 
 *  but now I know like the older children that go to that summer  # 
 *  I can't really blame their parents from taking them out of that and  # 
 *  but I mean preschool children like ...  # 
 *  it's different . now in the . in September it's going to be  # 
 *  and apparently the Toddlers down at Bris Baptist is going to be  # 
 *  because what they're going to do is like have a creche in the main  # 
 *  and riding  and things like that .  # 
 *  and that sort of thing .  # 
 *  and there's going to be . like you know you can borrow the  # 
 *  a toy library .  # 
 *  I think the reason was because the school wasn't ...  # 
 *  I mean it's undersubscribed . and . . people are getting  # 
 *  sausages Rachel   # 
 *  uhhuh it has .  # 
 *  yes xxx that's right . and free breakfast . a breakfast club  # 
 *  well you see as I says before there's a girl I know . that really  # 
 *  I'm not too sure . it depends it really depends . now I know  # 
 *  and . the same with Duncross primary school . though they don't  # 
 *  no so there isn't really anywhere else .  # 
 *  but I couldn't . I wouldn't be able to take Rachel anywhere else  # 
 *  you know .  # 
 *  well sort of we hope to in another couple of years . we'll see  # 
 *  well I think so aswell . I think so too .  # 
 *  yeah uhhuh .  # 
 *  well I think so aswell . and if suppose it just goes to show  # 
 *  you know .  # 
 *  tomato soup .  # 
 *  and else do you like Rachel   # 
 *  pasta .  # 
 *  you didn't eat pasta that I made for your lunch today . you  # 
 *  you just eat your bread .  # 
 *  and you just drank your milk . you drank your milk .  # 
 *  that was tuna and tomato sauce on your pasta today .  # 
 *  and you didn't eat it so you didn't . I bought that especially  # 
 *  Rachel's starting to go off all the things now that she liked as a  # 
 *  better not let this xxx . what else do you like Rachel . to eat  # 
 *  careful love some of that went into your ear .  # 
 *  do you like mashed potato and peas now . is that one of your  # 
 *  and tomato ketchup .  # 
 *  there wasn't . it was very quiet Rose ...  # 
 *  and we were surprised . because they usually like to jump on the  # 
 *  no no problems .  # 
 *  no problems at all .  # 
 *  uhhuh .  # 
 *  yes I know .  # 
 *  though I know Tollymount was pretty bad aswell . but this was  # 
 *  I couldn't believe it . you're sort of waiting for something to  # 
 *  not really not really . I mean . he managed . it wasn't too  # 
 *  mostly they go out at night now .  # 
 *  but that was terrible indeed .  # 
 *  yes we were thank goodness .  # 
 *  you know it was good to get away after all that tension .  # 
 *  I know it was beautiful . it was really beautiful .  # 
 *  lots .  # 
 *  are you a big hungry girl   # 
 *  is that your bread . oh that's very good .  # 
 *  that's good .  # 
 *  is that a biscuit   # 
 *  Mummy likes biscuits doesn't she   # 
 *  it's dough oh dear . silly Mum   # 
 *  what do you think of that   # 
 *  mm yum yum . we'll haveto try your dinner Rachel .  # 
 *  do you remember we went to the hospital last week . and saw the  # 
 *  do you remember   # 
 *  and what did we see   # 
 *  oh do you want to get the photograph of it to show Rose . we'll  # 
 *  wait to we see now . what way is it Rachel . och it's this way  # 
 *  and its head and its two wee hands .  # 
 *  twenty one .  # 
 *  girl baby .  # 
 *  no no no they say they have a notice up saying not to ask .  # 
 *  because it helps to avoid disappointment . because it's not a  # 
 *  I wouldn't ask anyhow .  # 
 *  is that right . I don't know . I would quite like a girl though  # 
 *  och I know .  # 
 *  so I really wanted a girl . really really .  # 
 *  I just think girls look nicer in pink . because once they get to  # 
 *  I think girls are quite ...  # 
 *  well my friend's got two boys and a girl .  # 
 *  you know the boys are about three and five and the girl's about a  # 
 *  I know .  # 
 *  my friend across the road . she's got a wee boy who's about a  # 
 *  and he's . he's pretty wild . you know I kept saying once he  # 
 *  and then we say probably once he gets to two he'll be okay .  # 
 *  she's yeah . she's very good . she's no trouble at all .  # 
 *  oh has he   # 
 *  I know .  # 
 *  that's the way I feel aswell . that you . I don't think I'll  # 
 *  laughs .  # 
 *  they all sound really macho .  # 
 *  oh that's great .  # 
 *  I know yeah I know . well I mean when Rachel was born she  # 
 *  and I tried to give her a dummy but . she didn't want it . but  # 
 *  and then she became really addicted .  # 
 *  no no no . and she came off it so easily . I mean I thought she  # 
 *  but it wasn't . she just lost it one day . and normally I would  # 
 *  so I says she didn't ask for it last night so she'll not you  # 
 *  so . just after that it was just occasionally . maybe if she  # 
 *  and she came off it so easily she really did .  # 
 *  I especially really worried because Peter was really worried .  # 
 *  you know it was getting to the stage I was looking for it and  # 
 *  yes yes yes uhhuh .  # 
 *  but this is true isn't it   # 
 *  oh I see so there's the blanket .  # 
 *  well probably quite likes her blanket . she would ask for it  # 
 *  but for some I think she must just like the comfort of it ...  # 
 *  because now and again she would ask me to get it for her . when  # 
 *  but after I had her . she was a terrible you know child . she  # 
 *  and any children I seen that were looked very content always had a  # 
 *  so I soon changed my mind . .. oh is that stuck on   # 
 *  and what school's your oldest son going to then   #

 *  oh that's good .  # 
 *  that's great because it'll not be long before they're back at  #

 *  I'm not too sure now . if that's the ones that are the ones that  # 
 *  but they were all . they were all girls .  #

 *  and here's me .  # 
 *  no no what happened originally . we'd said my brother and . Jim  # 
 *  that's what we'd originally been thinking and then I says to Jim  # 
 *  and I says to Jim I think I'll have something here  .  # 
 *  I'll get my aunt Ann and my aunt Joyce . that's her sister in  # 
 *  and her husband and . . Peggy and George . friends of my  # 
 *  so Jim says it's up to you whatever you want to do you know   # 
 *  and . so we'd said to her . Bill went and said to her about  # 
 *  I never thought of that .  # 
 *  yeah so she told me this and I says see you she's gonna catch on  # 
 *  and I says don't you phone her anymore  so she told me this on  # 
 *  and she says yeah I just want it nice and quiet  .  # 
 *  so I says to Bill I told her she's coming here for her dinner   # 
 *  no I wasn't working .  # 
 *  I told her today I'm working .  # 
 *  but I normally go down and take her for her pension and that and  # 
 *  so I says I've to go to the dentist tomorrow morning so I'll not  # 
 *  even when I went down she never said to me how did you get on at  # 
 *  so away I was to Iceland to get my cakes and my bread and all you  # 
 *  so I went and my cousin was bringing my aunt from Carrick up and  # 
 *  and he went down and got my other two aunts and Peggy and George  # 
 *  well I had to get washing off the line so I phoned the fella and  # 
 *  so I says I better go on up or these stewed bugs and onions will  # 
 *  and I had the door locked and the curtains across and I phoned her  # 
 *  and I pinched a tray for the potatoes and all . see the stuff I  # 
 *  so I phoned her down and I says your stewed bugs and onions are  # 
 *  cause I knew everybody was here at that stage . so we waited and  # 
 *  what darling yes you want me   # 
 *  and she comes to the door and I says here we go  and I had the  #
