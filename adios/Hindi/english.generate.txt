 *  CBI  could  question  Odisha  chief  minister  Naveen  Patnaik  in connection with  alleged irregularities in the  utilisation of coal  block  to  Hindalco  as  he  had  written  a  letter  to the  coal  ministry  after  application  of the  Aditya Birla  company  was  rejected  in  2005.  #
 *  CBI sources said  as  its  officials  were  scrutinizing  the  documents  they  found  a  letter  written  by  Patnaik  requesting  for the  relook  and  reverse  rejection  of  Hindalco's  application  for  Talabira II  block  in  Odisha.  #
 *  CBI  said  while  no  final  decision  has been  taken  as  to  who  all  would  be  questioned,  the  sources  said  the  chief  minister  would  be  questioned  only  if  need  was  felt  to  seek  his  views  on the  reasons  for  recommending  coal blocks  to  Hindalco.  #
 *  CBI sources said  46-year-old  Kumar  Manglam  Birla,  chairman  of  Aditya Birla  Group,  had  written  a  letter  to the  Prime Minister's  Office  which  had  forwarded  the  letter  to the  coal  ministry.  #
 *  CBI  has  alleged  in  its  FIR  after  rejection  of  Hindalco's  plea  in  2005,  Birla  wrote  two  letters  and  held  a  "personal  meeting"  with  the  then  coal  secretary  PC  Parakh,  after  which  a  decision  was  reversed  and  Hindalco  was  given  the  block  which  was  earlier  meant  for  two  public  sector  undertakings  Mahanadi  Coal  Fields  and  Neyveli  Lignite.  #
 *  "Pursuant  to  these  letters  and  personal  meeting  between  Parakh  and  Birla,  Parakh,  by  abusing  his  official  position  as the  public  servant,  recommended  the  allocation of  Talabira II  along  with  Talabira  III  coal block  to  Hindalco  Industries  Limited,  along  with  other  two  companies  without  any  valid  basis  or  change  in  circumstances  and  with  the  sole  intention  to  show  undue  favours  to  Hindalco  Industries  Limited,"  the  agency  alleged  in  its  FIR.  #
 *  The  allegations  have been  denied  by  Hindalco  and  Parakh.  #
 *  The  former coal secretary  has  said  if  he  was  a  conspirator,  so  was  Prime Minister  as  he  had  signed  the  allocation  letter  to  Hindalco.  #
 *  The  agency,  in the  meanwhile,  has  started  scrutinizing  the  documents  recovered  from  searches  at  the  five  offices  of  Hindalco  and  residence  of  Parakh  in  Hyderabad  on  October  15.  #
 *  The prosecutor said  the  agency  would  question  Birla  and  Parakh  in connection with  the  case  but  that  might  take  time  as  CBI  officials  would  first  examine  the  documents  to  gather  material  evidence.  #
 *  Sources  said  the  FIR  is  the  first  step  and  all  the  allegations  would  be  probed  during  the  course  of  investigations.  #
 *  They said  the  agency  has  named  people  in the  FIR  only  affecting the  prima facie  evidence  basis  and  further  investigation  is  going  on.  #
 *  Even  as  he  drew  all  round  support  from  industry  and  some  ministers,  Kumar Mangalam Birla,  on  Friday  broke  his  silence  rubbishing  CBI  charges  against  him  in  a  coal block allocation  case  saying  he  was  not  worried  as  no  wrong  has been  committed.  #
 *  Birla,  chairman  of the  Aditya Birla  group  flagship  firm  Hindalco,  met  finance  minister  P  Chidambaram  and  revenue  secretary  Sumit  Bose  and  later  told reporters  that  he  had  discussed  the  FIR  issue  with  the  minister.  #
 *  "As  of  now  I  am  not  worried  about  it.  #
 *  There was  nothing  wrong  (that)  has been  done.  #
 *  So  why  should  one  worry?"  #
 *  He  was  asked  whether  the CBI  FIR  naming  him  and  Hindalco  in the  coalgate  scam  would  cast  a  shadow  affecting the  Aditya Birla  Group's  application  and a  bank  licence.  #
 *  Meanwhile,  industry  body  CII  on  Friday  joined  others  in  slamming  the  FIR  against  Birla  but  issued  a  nuanced  statement  saying  while  CBI  had  the  right  to  proceed  against  anyone  it  should  be  careful  before  taking  action  against  reputed  industrialists  to  avoid  creating  a  sense  of  fear.  #
 *  Without  referring  to the  Birla  case,  CII  chief  Kris  Gopalakrishnan  said,  "It is  desirable  to  ensure  that  all  facts  of the  case  are  laid  upfront  before  proceeding  against  respected  and  reputed  individuals."  #
 *  He  said  that  reputations  of  institutions  and  individuals  take  years  to  build  and  therefore,  extreme  caution  needs  to be  exercised  before  any  action  is  taken,  which  jeopardizes  reputation  that  institutions  and  individuals  build  for  themselves.  #
 *  The  coal block  that  triggered  a  CBI  case  against  Kumar Mangalam Birla,  cannot  start  production  for  another  four  to  five  years  as  it  has  not  been  able  to  get  clearances  from  various  authorities  since  it  was  allotted  in  2005.  #
 *  The CBI  has  alleged  that  former coal secretary  PC  Parakh  abused  his  position  to  award  part  of the  Talabira  2&3  block  in  Odisha  to  Birla-promoted  HindalcoBSE  0.90  %  -  a  charge  emphatically  denied  by  both.  #
 *  But  affecting the  ground,  Hindalco  and  two  state  miners  -  Mahanadi  Coalfields  and  Neyveli  Lignite,  which  have  stakes  in the  venture,  have  not  been  able  to  make  progress  in the  absence  of  necessary  approvals  from  Central  and  state  authorities.  #
 *  The  coal  ministry  has  even  issued  notices  to the  three  firms  for  delay  in  developing  the  block.  #
 *  A  senior  official  in  Mahanadi  Coalfields,  which  is  carrying  out  project  activities  for  mine  development,  said  all  major  milestones  including  obtaining  the  mining  lease,  land  acquisition  and  forest  clearances  were  pending.  #
 *  "The  block  may  take  anywhere  between  four  to  five  years  to  start  production  as  no  progress  has been  made.  #
 *  The  attached  end-use  projects  will  come  up  before  the  block  (is  ready  for  mining),"  he  said.  #
 *  A  coal  ministry  official  said  Hindalco  has  invested  as  much  as  Rs  17,000  crore  in the  attached  900-mw  captive  power  plant,  a  1.5  million  tonnes  aluminium  refinery  and a  3.5  lakh  tonne  smelter  in  Odisha.  #
 *  The  three  firms  had  floated  a  joint  venture  company  called  MNH  Sakthi  Ltd  with  equity  holding  of  70%  by  Mahanadi  Coalfields  and  15%  each  by  Neyveli  Lignite  and  Hindalco  to  develop  the  block  and  share  the  production  in  that  ratio.  #
 *  The  first  application  and a  Talabira  2  &  3  mine,  which  has  152  million  tonnes  of  reserves,  was  made  by  Indal  in  1996.  #
 *  The  company  was  acquired  by  Hindalco  in  2000  which  was  allocated  the  mine  on  November  10,  2005.  #
 *  The  investigating  agency  has  alleged  that  Birla  influenced  Parakh  to  overturn  a  decision  of the  25th  screening committee  that  earmarked  the  coal block  for  government  companies.  #
 *  The  FIR  filed  on  Tuesday  alleged  criminal conspiracy  by  Birla  and  misuse  of  position  by  Parekh.  #
 *  Hindalco  had  said  it  followed every process required for  coal blocks allocation  in  line  with  government  regulations.  #
 *  The CBI  is  investigating  irregularities  in  coal block  allotments  made  to  private  companies  after  the  CAG  alleged  that  coal  worth  Rs  1.86  lakh  crore  was  given  free  by the  government.  #
 *  The  CBI,  which  is  carrying  out  Supreme  Court-monitored  probe into the  Coalgate  scam,  may  book  some  more  private  companies  soon  which  were  allegedly  awarded  blocks  in  violation  of  norms.  #
 *  "There  are  other  companies  also,  which  had  been  favoured  by  government  servants  at  different  levels,"  said  a  senior  CBI  officer  two  days  after  the  agency  named  Kumar Mangalam Birla  and  his  company  Hindalco  along  with  former coal secretary  P  C  Parakh  in  an  FIR  filed  in connection with  allegedly  illegal  allotment  of  a  coal block  in  Odisha.  #
 *  Sources  said  CBI  has  recovered  some  documents  which  suggest  that  Hindalco's  bid  for a  coal block  was  also  backed  by  Odisha  CM  Naveen  Patnaik  after  it  had  been  turned  down  by the  screening committee  under  the  coal  ministry.  #
 *  Patnaik  accepted  having  recommended  Hindalco's  case  for  Talabira II  coal block  in  Odisha,  but  defended  his  action  by  saying  the  project  would  have  brought  revenue  and  jobs  to the  state.  #
 *  "The  letter  was  written  because  the  state  would  have  a  great  deal  of  revenue  and  many  jobs,"  Patnaik  told  media  persons  who  had  approached  the  CM  for  his  reaction  to  reports  on  TV  channels  saying  he  may  be  questioned  by the  CBI  in connection with  the  Hindalco  case.  #
 *  "Let  me  clarify  that  no  information  has been  received  regarding  questioning  or  otherwise,"  Patnaik  said.  #
 *  In  Delhi,  CBI  director  Ranjit  Sinha  confirmed  that  Patnaik's  recommendation  for  Hindalco  was  being  examined,  but  refrained  from  confirming  reports  that  his  team  planned  to  question  the  Odisha  CM  shortly.  #
 *  "We  will  examine  whosoever  is  required  to be  examined,"  he  said.  #
 *  Sources  said  the  agency  does  not  have  any  plan  to  question  Patnaik  yet.  #
 *  A  senior  officer  said,  "Most  of the  coal blocks  had  been  recommended  by  state  governments  only.  #
 *  We  will  examine  under  what  circumstances  the  chief  minister's  office  recommended  Hindalco  when  there  were  other  applicants  as  well.  #
 *  But  that  doesn't  mean  Naveen  Patnaik  is  under  probe."  #
 *  The  CM's  office  in  Bhubaneswar  said  Patnaik  wrote  to the  PM  in  August  2005  to  support  Hindalco's  bid  for  Talabira II  "keeping  the  best  interests  of the  state  in  mind".  #
 *  In  its  FIR,  CBI  has  alleged  that  while  the  screening committee  at  its  25th  meeting  had  turned  down  Hindalco's  bid  for  Talabira II  and  had  awarded  the  block  to  PSUs  Neyveli  Lignite  Corporation  and  Mahanadi  Coalfields  Limited,  the  decision  was  reversed  after  a  meeting  between  the  then  coal  secretary  P  C  Parakh  and  Kumar  Mangalam  Birla.  #
 *  The  agency  has  not  accused  Parakh,  widely  reputed  for  his  probity,  for  quid pro  quo,  but  has  accused  him  of  misusing  his  official  power  to  reverse  the  decision  of the  screening committee  to  allocate  a  coal block  exclusively  marked  for  PSUs  to  Hindalco.  #
 *  Oil  minister  Veerappa  Moily  has  rejected  a  draft  note  for a  Cabinet  proposing  exploration  of  coal-bed  methane  (CBM)  rights  to  state-run  Coal  India  without  auction  and  directed  bureaucrats  to  re-draft  it  to  encourage  competition  and  efficiency,  officials  said.  #
 *  Moily  rejected  the  proposal  saying  Coal  India  should  not  get  automatic  rights  of  over  CBM  exploration  only  because  most  of  coal blocks  are  held  by the  public  sector  firm,  which  is  the  single  largest  coal  producing  company  in the  world.  #
 *  "Coal  India  is  not  an  expert  in  CBM  exploration  as  ONGC  is  not  an  expert  in  coal  mining.  #
 *  The  government  can't  allow  ONGC  to  mine  coal  just  because  coal  is  found  in  its  oil  and  gas  blocks,"  a  senior  oil  ministry  official  said.  #
 *  Coal  India  operates  over  470  coal  mines  in  eight  states.  #
 *  Moily  has  also  put  in  a  new  team  of  officials  to  re-draft  the  note,  which  is  expected  to be  ready  by  November,  officials  said.  #
 *  According  to  laws  governing  mining  in  India,  coal  mining  is  the  mandate  of the  coal  ministry  while  the  oil  ministry  regulates  exploration  of  CBM.  #
 *  Some  scam-wary  bureaucrats  in the  oil  ministry,  however,  favoured  giving  blocks  only  to  public  sector  energy  firms  to  avoid  controversies  and  ensure  immunity  from  investigative  agencies.  #
 *  Officials  said  if  they  allowed  private  investments  in  these  coal  blocks,  the  Central Bureau of Investigation  (CBI)  might  start  a  witchhunt  later  like  what  has  happened  to the  former coal secretary  Prakash  Chandra  Parakh.  #
 *  CBI  on  Tuesday  filed  a  first  information  report  against  Hindalco,  Kumar Mangalam Birla  and  Parekh  on  alleged irregularities in the  allocation of  a  coal  block.  #
 *  Even  the  finance  ministry  had  raised  objections  that  allowing  private  companies  to  explore  shale  resources  in  their  existing  blocks  would  amount  to  giving  them  undue  benefits  post  auction,  an  official  said  requesting  anonymity.  #
 *  In  order  to  avoid  controversies,  the  government  approved  a  shale  gas  policy  last  month  that  allowed  only  state  firmsONGC  and  Oil  India-to  explore  shale  resources  in  oil  and  gas  blocks  held  by  them.  #
 *  The  policy  was  approved  in  spite  of  Moily's  initial  resistance  to  exclude  private  explorers.  #
 *  "The  policy  was  approved,  but  not  without  a  strong  note  by the  oil  minister.  #
 *  He  directed  the  ministry  to  prepare  another  policy  allowing  private  companies  in  shale  exploration,  which  needs  new  technology  and  huge  investments,"  the  official  said  requesting  anonymity.  #
 *  The  oil  ministry  on  Monday  issued  shale  exploration  guidelines  to  ONGC  and  Oil  India,  which  provided  strict  timelines  for  companies  to  complete  specified  minimum  exploration  works,  officials  said.  #
 *  P  C  Parakh  is  not  the  only  former coal secretary  who  spoke  against  the  flawed  manner  of  allocation of coal  blocks.  #
 *  In  his  exit  interview  to  CAG  in  February  2012,  the  then  coal  secretary  Alok  Perti  told  the  auditor  that  coal blocks  were  being  allocated  without  adequate  due  diligence  and  were  being  cornered  by  companies  which  did  not  have  the  wherewithal  to  mine  the  deposits.  #
 *  Perti  said  the  allocation of coal blocks  to  ill-equipped  and  undeserving  beneficiaries  was  the  main  reason  why  coal  could  not  be  mined  from  many  of the  blocks.  #
 *  He  said  the  allottees  were  hamstrung  to  mine  the  deposits  themselves,  and  they  were  also  unable  to  find  foreign  collaborators  who  would  look  for  stakes:  something  which  was  not  provided  under  the  captive  consumption  agreement.  #
 *  "There  was  lack  of  expertise  in the  private  sector  for  mining  and  foreign  parties  were  reluctant  to  come  unless  they  were  provided  a  part  of the  coal  production,"  Perti  told  CAG  in  his  exit  interview  affecting the  failure  of  companies  to  start  mining.  #
 *  CAG  highlighted  the  lack  of  due  diligence  as  many  of  these  companies  which  bagged  blocks  were  not  competent  to be  allocated  mines  since  they  had  no  expertise  in  mining  and  had  not  provided  any  assurance  how  they  will  achieve  this  task  once  mines  were  allocated.  #
 *  A  day  after  it  lodged  an FIR naming Hindalco and  its  boss  Kumar Mangalam Birla,  CBI  said  it  had  recovered  Rs 25 crore  in  cash  from  the  corporate  office  of the  aluminum  major  in the  city.  #
 *  The  cash  was  found  by the  CBI  team  which  searched  the  Hindalco  office  in connection with  the  FIR  on  Tuesday  into  the  illegal  allocation of  a  coal  mine  to the  company,  CBI  spokesperson  Kanchan  Prasad  said.  #
 *  She  also  said  the  money  was  handed  over  to the  income  tax  department  for the  probe.  #
 *  The  I-T  department  is expected to  issue  a  notice  to the  company  shortly.  #
 *  When  contacted,  Hindalco's  spokesperson  reacted  to  CBI's  claim  by  saying  "we  have  to  find  out".  #
 *  CBI sources said  the  money  was  seized  and  handed  over  to the  I-T  department  after  company  officials  failed  to  account  for the  big  amount.  #
 *  Sources  also  claimed  that  documents  relevant  for  their  investigation  into  the  mining  rights  for the  coal block  in  Odisha,  Talbaria  II,  to  Hindalco  were  recovered  during  the  searches  carried out  in the  offices  of the  company  in  Delhi  and  Mumbai.  #
 *  Sources  said  officials  belonging  to  CBI's  Economic  Offence  Wing  also  found  gold  coins  in the  offices.  #
 *  The  FIR  against  Birla  and  Hindalco,  along  with  former coal secretary  PC  Parakh,  has  sent  jitters  among  industry  and  bureaucracy.  #
 *  Many  consider  Birla  to be  a  respecter  of  rules,  while  Parakh  has  a  reputation  for  probity.  #
 *  However,  CBI  sources  justified  the  action  by  pointing  to the  details  of  their  FIR  against  the  top-notch  businessman  for a  bureaucrat  widely  perceived  to be  a  stickler  for  rules.  #
 *  The  FIR  alleges  that some  award  of  15%  mining  rights  for  Talabira II  forced  Neyveli  Lignite  Corporation  (NLC),  the  PSU  which  was  allotted  the  coal block  earmarked  exclusively  for  government  entities,  to  scrap  its  plan  to  set  up  a  power  plant.  #
 *  Reacting  to  Parakh's  allegation  that  "CBI  did  not  understand  the  case",  sources  in the  agency  said  the  FIR  was  registered  after  a  painstaking  process  of  due  diligence  and  was  based  on  facts.  #
 *  They  also  said  the  agency  would  inform  the  Supreme Court  about  the  FIR  during  the  next  hearing  on  Coalgate.  #
 *  In  its  FIR,  CBI  alleged  that  Parakh  upturned  his  own  decision  in  giving  Hindalco  mining  rights  for  15%  of  Talabira  II's  coal  deposit.  #
 *  Significantly,  it  has  not  accused  the  former  bureaucrat  of  a  quid pro  quo:  in  short,  that  he  changed  his  decision  for  gains,  only  charging  him  with  misuse  of  official  position.  #
 *  The  agency  also  refuted  Parakh's  claim  that  "CBI  did  not  understand  the  case".  #
 *  A  senior  officer  said,  "The  case  has been  registered  after  thorough  enquiry  and  is  based  on  documents.  #
 *  In  fact,  we  are  going  to  inform  Supreme Court  about  it  in the  next  hearing."  #
 *  According  to the  FIR,  the  Parakh-led  screening committee  under  the  coal  ministry  --  the  body  which  allocated  coal blocks  --  had  in  its  25th  meeting  in  June  2005  turned  down  Hindalco's  application  for a  allocation of  Talabira II  block.  #
 *  The  coal block  was  allocated  to  NLC  to be  mined  along  with  Talabira  III  with  another  PSU,  Mahanadi  Coalfields  Ltd  (MCL).  #
 *  Accordingly,  the  allocation  letter  was  issued  to  NLC  and  MCL  on  July  15,  2005.  #
 *  CBI  has  alleged  that  Parakh  changed  his  stand  after  a meeting with  Birla  in the  same  month,  stressing  that some  businessman  had  written  two  letters,  on  May  7,  2005  and,  again  on  June  17  that  year,  to  stake  Hindalco's  claim  for  Talabira II  coal  block.  #
 *  Disregarding  the  decision  of the  screening  committee,  Parakh  proposed  the  formation  of  a  joint  venture  company  between  MCL,  NLC  and  Hindalco  with  the  equity  shareholding  of  70%,  15%  and  15%.  #
 *  The CBI  action  on  a  top  industrialist  and  senior  former  bureaucrats  will  demoralize  civil  servants  and  heap  another  bout  of  "policy  paralysis"  on the  system,  experts  warned  on  Wednesday.  #
 *  Some  former  civil  servants  said  bureaucrats  will  now  be  scared  to  take  decisions  for  fear  of  being  sent  to  jail  once  they  retire.  #
 *  "Bureaucrats  will  not  take  any  initiatives  now.  #
 *  They  will  play  crossword  and  golf.  #
 *  After  all,  nobody  wants  to  go  to  jail  at  the  age  of  60  for  taking  decisions,"  former  cabinet  secretary  TSR  Subramanian  said.  #
 *  "Anyway,  this  is  election  time  and  everything  will  slow  down.  #
 *  Decision-making  will  slow  down.  #
 *  Investments  are  down  and  decision-making  will  stall,"  the  former  bureaucrat  said.  #
 *  The  2G  spectrum  scam  had  sparked  off  "policy  paralysis"  as  civil  servants  delayed  taking  decisions  for  fear  of  being  prosecuted.  #
 *  This  stalled  decision-making  in the  government,  scared  investors  away  and  deeply  hurt  growth  which  slowed  to  a  decade's  low  of  5%  in  2012-13.  #
 *  Delayed  decisions  and  policy  uncertainty  hurt  the  industrial  sector,  shaving  off  much  needed  growth.  #
 *  The  mining  sector  was  the  worst  hit  and  is  yet  to  recover  from  the  blows  inflicted  by  policy  inaction  and  regulatory  delays.  #
 *  "This  incident  will  demoralize  senior  officers  who  have  to  take  complex  decisions.  #
 *  There  has  to be  some  solid  evidence.  #
 *  You  cannot  jump  the  gun  like  this,  you  cannot  criminalize  every  administrative  decision,"  former  cabinet  secretary  Naresh  Chandra  said,  adding  that  this  would  impact  decision-making  in the  government.  #
 *  Chandra  said  the CBI  was  being  trigger  happy  and  hoped  that  it  had  solid  evidence  to  back  up  its  claims.  #
 *  "Obviously  it  won't  go  down  well  with  the  bureaucracy.  #
 *  I  hope  the CBI  has  concrete  evidence.  #
 *  They  are  now  indulging  in  trigger  happy  investigations.  #
 *  It  seems  to be  a  shortcut  FIR,"  said  Chandra.  #
 *  Civil  servants  and  experts  also  questioned  the  move  to  lodge  a  first  information  report  against  former coal secretary  P  C  Parakh.  #
 *  "Both  Parakh  and  H  C  Gupta  (another  former  coal  secretary)  have  spotless  reputations.  #
 *  By  reputation,  they  are  some  of the  most  honest  bureaucrats.  #
 *  If  you  catch  hold  of  them  then  you  are  doing  great  damage  to the  system.  #
 *  I  am  not  saying  there  are  no  crooks  in the  system  but  catch  hold  of the  crooks,"  Subramanian  said.  #
 *  A  Cabinet  minister,  who  did  not  wish  to be  identified,  said  the CBI  action  would  scare  foreign  investors  and  prompt  bureaucrats  to  only  clear  routine  files.  #
 *  "What  will  foreign  investors  think  when  they  read  this  news.  #
 *  They  will  say  it  is  better  not  to  venture  out  there,"  said  the  minister.  #
 *  The CBI  on  Tuesday  registered  an  FIR  against  one  of  India's  best-known  industrialists  Kumar Mangalam Birla,  and  his  company  Hindalco,  along  with  former coal secretary  P  C  Parakh,  for  alleged irregularities in the  allocation of  a  coal  block,  sending  shockwaves  among  the  corporate  world  and  bureaucracy.  #
 *  It  also  put  a  fresh  spotlight  on  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  with  Parakh  alleging  that some  allocation  was  approved  by the  PM  and  the CBI  should  have  made  him  the  "accused  number  one".  #
 *  Sources  said  the  FIR,  the  14th  into  the  mega  scam,  relates  to the  allegedly  illegality  in  letting  Hindalco  access  15%  of the  deposits  from  a  coal block  in  Odisha,  Talabira  II,  which  was  earmarked  exclusively  for  PSUs.  #
 *  The  AV  Birla  Group  angrily  reacted  to the  allegation  and  dismissed  it  as  preposterous.  #
 *  "The  reality  of the  matter  is  very  different  from  what  has been  projected  ...  the  actual  allocation  of the  mine  was  done  in  November  2005,  which  is  nine  years  after  the  first  application  was  made.  #
 *  To  imply  that  our  chairman,  Kumar Mangalam Birla,  managed  to  overturn  the  decision  of the  screening committee  is  preposterous,"  Hindalco  MD  Debu  Bhattacharya  said  in  a  statement.  #
 *  CBI  sources  familiar  with  details  of the  case  said  those  named  in the  FIR  have been  accused  of  criminal  conspiracy,  criminal  misconduct  and  misuse  of  official  position  under  Section  120-B  of the  Indian  Penal  Code  and  relevant  sections  of the Prevention of Corruption  Act.  #
 *  CBI  teams  carried out  coordinated  searches  at  six locations in Mumbai,  Hyderabad,  Delhi  and  Bhubaneswar.  #
 *  The  development  also  came  as a  jolt  to the  bureaucracy,  surprising  many  senior  officials  who  sympathized  with  Parakh.  #
 *  The  former coal secretary  has  a  reputation  for  honesty,  and  had  criticized  the  policy  of  allocation of coal blocks  by the  government,  saying  it  led  to  windfall  gains  and the  allottees.  #
 *  In  fact,  he  had  also  argued  for a  blocks  to be  auctioned.  #
 *  Parakh  is  the  second  former coal secretary  after  H  C  Gupta  to be  named  in  a  Coalgate  case.  #
 *  Given  Birla's  standing  as a  leading  corporate  chief  who  has  not  been  stained  by  any  controversy,  as  well  as  Parakh's  credentials  as  an  honest  bureaucrat,  there  was  considerable  curiosity  about  the  type  of  evidence  CBI  has  collected.  #
 *  The  FIR,  it  is  learnt,  does  not  mention  the  date  or  venue  where  Birla  met  Parakh  to  get  the  decision  of the  screening committee  altered.  #
 *  It is  also  silent  on  whether  money  changed  hands  or  favours  were  granted.  #
 *  However,  sources  in the  CBI  justified  the  FIR  saying  it  was  based  on  evidence  gathered  through  professional  investigation.  #
 *  "We  have  foolproof  evidence,"  a  senior  CBI  officer  said.  #
 *  Giving  details,  sources  said  Talabira II  was  allocated  to  a  PSU,  Neyveli  Lignite  Corporation  (NLC),  while  Talabira  III  was  allocated  to  another  PSU,  Mahanadi  Coalfields  Limited,  in  2005  under  what  was  known  as  "government  dispensation  scheme".  #
 *  The  coal blocks  allocated  under  the  scheme  were  to be  mined  exclusively  by  PSUs.  #
 *  However,  the  decision  was  changed  after  Birla  had  a  detailed  meeting  with  then  coal  secretary  Parakh,  CBI  sources  claimed.  #
 *  The  investigating  agency  has  accused  Parkah  of  overturning  the  decision,  taken  by the  screening committee  of the  coal  ministry  at  its  25th  meeting,  and  let  Hindalco  mine  Talabira II  on  a  sharing  basis.  #
 *  The  agency  has  also  alleged  that  while  the  irregularity  hurt  NLC,  the  PSU  chose  to  keep  mum.  #
 *  "To  include  a  private  company  was  against  the  norms  as the  allocations  were  done  under  government  dispensation  scheme  where  only  PSUs  were  eligible,"  said  a  senior  CBI  officer.  #
 *  This is  the  first  FIR  to  have been  filed  by the  CBI  in connection with  the  alleged irregularities in the  implementation  of the  "government  dispensation  scheme".  #
 *  According  to  a  coal  ministry  showcause  notice  issued  on  September  29,  2010  to  Hindalco,  NLC  and  Mahanadi  Coalfield,  mining  has  not  started  in  Talabira  I  and  Talabira II  yet.  #
 *  The  show  cause  notice  said  "critical  milestones  such  as  bank  guarantee,  forest  clearance,  land  acquisition  were  still  pending  and the  Talabira II  coal  block".  #
 *  The  Supreme Court  monitored  Coalgate  investigation  has  already  seen  the CBI  naming  Naveen  Jindal,  a  Congress MP  and  chairman  of  Jindal  Steel  and  Power  Ltd,  former  Union  minister  Dasari Narayana  Rao,  Lokmat  group  chief  and  Congress MP  Vijay  Darda  and  several  other  industrialists  and  officials.  #
 *  The  probe  has  witnessed  several  dramatic  moments,  as  an  attempt  by  Ashwini  Kumar  to  interfere  with  the CBI  probe  when  he  was  law  minister  resulted  in  his  exit  from  the  Cabinet.  #
 *  Several  crucial  files  on  utilisation of coal blocks  have  mysteriously  disappeared  from  the  government,  leading  the  opposition  to  demand  the  resignation  of the  prime  minister.  #
 *  After  a  wait  of  three  months,  the CBI  finally  questioned  Congress MP  and  industrialist  Naveen  Jindal  in connection with  the  Coalgate  scam  on  Thursday.  #
 *  According  to  sources,  Jindal  was  questioned  at  a  CBI  guesthouse  in  an  undisclosed  location  for  several  hours  and  he  was  asked  about  his  role  in the  utilisation of coal  block  to  his  company.  #
 *  Jindal  has been  booked  along  with  former  Minister of state for  coal  Dasari Narayana  Rao  and  screening committee  members  for  alleged  cheating and  criminal conspiracy  in  bagging  Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block  in  Jharkhand  in  2008.  #
 *  A  source  said  Jindal  was  asked  whether  he  influenced  the  decision  of the  screening committee  as a  Congress  leader  and  about  the  alleged  bribe  paid  to  Rao  for  favouring  his  company.  #
 *  Though  CBI  did  not  confirm,  sources  said  Jindal  joined  the  questioning  at  11  am  and  left  around  5  pm.  #
 *  Officials  said  he  would  be  called  again  as  he  is  an investor in the  case.  #
 *  The  agency  conceded  his  request  that  he  should  not  be  subjected  to  media  glare  after  which  the  venue  was  changed  from  the CBI  headquarters  to  a  guesthouse  where  his  examination  took  place,  they  said.  #
 *  Jindal  Steel  and  Power  Limited  did  not  comment  on  his  questioning.  #
 *  The  development  comes  at  a  time  when  CBI  is  already  planning  to  file  chargesheets  in  five  of  its  13  cases  registered  so  far  in the  Coalgate  scam,  said  sources.  #
 *  CBI  has  already  questioned  some  Jharkhand  government  officials,  screening committee  members,  former coal secretary  H  C  Gupta  and  other  officials  of  coal  and  power  ministries  in  this  case.  #
 *  During  its  probe,  the  then  minister of state  was  named  as  an accused in the  FIR  in  which  it  was  alleged  that  he  had  received  Rs  2.25  crore  camouflaged  as  investment  from  one  of  Jindal's  firms  within  a  year  of  allocation of a coal block to  him.  #
 *  CBI sources said  Jindal  Steel  and  Power  Limited  and  Gagan Sponge Iron  Limited,  also  a  Jindal  firm,  had  bagged  Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block  in  Birbhum,  Jharkhand  in  2008  by  alleged  misrepresentation  of  facts  when  Rao  was  minister of state for  coal.  #
 *  Reacting  to the  FIR,  head  of  external  affairs,  JSPL  Manu  Kapoor  had  said  earlier,  "JSPL,  as a  law  abiding  company, is governed by a strong ethical code of  conduct.  #
 *  This is an ongoing CBI investigation into  coal block  allocation.  #
 *  At this stage of investigation, JSPL is committed to fully cooperate with  CBI."  #
 *  The  Supreme Court  on  Thursday  expanded  the scope of the coal scam  investigations  and  issued  notice  to  7  states  -  Jharhand,  Chhattisarh,  Andhra  Pradesh,  Odisha,  Madhya  Pradesh  and  West  Bengal.  #
 *  The  apex court  wants  to  know  from  these  states  their  role  in the  allocation of coal blocks  done  by the  Centre.  #
 *  The  SC  decided  to  seek  view  of the  states  after  the  Centre  said  utilisation of coal blocks  was  mere  identification  of  mines  for  private  parties  for  captive  consumption  purposes.  #
 *  The  SC  asked  the  states  to  answer  what  did  they  understand  by  allocation of coal blocks  by the  Centre.  #
 *  States  were  also  asked  to  answer  whether  competitive  bidding  was  needed  for  coal block  allocations.  #
 *  The  next  hearing  in the  case  is  scheduled  on  October  29.  #
 *  Claiming  that  there  was  no  scam  in  coal  sector,  including  that  of  coal block allocation  in  states,  Union  coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal  on  Tuesday  said,  the  Centre  will  specially  consider  the  case  of  Odisha  if  it  participated  in the  bidding  process  for  allotment  of  five  new  coal blocks  in the  Talcher  area.  #
 *  There is  no  scam  in the  coal  sector  during  the  UPA  Government.  #
 *  Coal  blocks  are  being  allocated  since  1993  and  we  have  followed  the  process.  #
 *  The  previous  NDA  government  had  allocated  43  coal blocks  during  its  tenure,  Mr.  #
 *  Jaiswal  told reporters  in  Bhubaneswar.  #
 *  Stating  that  since  the  Coal  India  Limited  (CIL)  alone  cannot  meet  the  growing  demands  of  coal,  Mr.  #
 *  Jaiswal  said,  the  government  allocated  coal blocks  to  private  players  as  done  by  previous  governments.  #
 *  How  can  you  say  that  all  governments  indulged  in  scam  in  coal block  allocation,  he  asked  adding  that  from  Narashima  Rao  to  Atal  Behari  Vajpayee  government,  all  allocated  coal blocks  to  private  companies.  #
 *  To  a  question  on  de-allocation  of  three  coal blocks  given  to  Odishas  public  sector  undertakings,  Mr.  #
 *  Jaiswal  said,  the  Ministry  has  absolutely  no  role  in the  process.  #
 *  Those  who  failed  to  achieve  the  milestone  have been  served  with  de-allocation  notices,  he  said.  #
 *  On  Odisha  governments  demand  of  re-allocation  of  de-allocated  coal  blocks,  Mr.  #
 *  Jaiswal  said,  We  cannot  do  that  (re-allocation).  #
 *  The  inter-ministerial  group  takes  decision  in  that  regard.  #
 *  The  Ministry  has  no  role  in  that.  #
 *  When  asked  about  Odishas  steel  and  mines  minister  R  K  Singhs  statement  on  re-allocation  of  de-allocated  coal blocks  to  central  PSUs  like  NTPC,  the  Union  Minister  said,  We  had  given  commitment  to  NTPC,  but  never  given  similar  assurance  to  Odisha  government.  #
 *  Earlier,  the  Coal Ministry  had  de-allocated  three  coal blocks  like  Utkal-D,  Mandakini-B  and  Radhikapur-E  coal blocks  allocated  to  Odisha  Mining  Corporation  (OMC)  and  Odisha  Hydro  Power  Corporation  (OHPC)  respectively.  #
 *  The  state  government  had  recently  submitted  a  memorandum  to the  Centre  demanding  re-allocation  of the  three  coal blocks  in favour of  State  PSUs.  #
 *  The  Union  Minister,  however,  said  that some  Ministry  will  specially  consider  the  case  of  Odisha  if  it  participated  in the  fresh  tender  for  five  coal blocks  located  in the  State.  #
 *  We  will  specially  consider  Odishas  case  if  it  participates  in the  bidding  process  for  5  coal  blocks,  Mr.  #
 *  Jaiswal  said.  #
 *  The  Ministry  of  Coal  has  put  five  coal blocks  Kudanali-Laburi,  Sarapal-Napara,  Tentuloi,  Chandrabila  and  Brahmani  in the  Talcher  coalfield  for  tender.  #
 *  Last  date  of  tender  for a  five  blocks  has been  extended  till  February  8.  #
 *  Odisha  government  has  already  applied  for  bidding  process  for  four  coal blocks  except  Brahmani,  sources  said.  #
 *  When  reporters  pointed  out  that  though  three  coal blocks  of  Odisha  PSUs  have been  de-allocated  for  non-performance,  same  yardstick  is  not  used  for  Chendipada  coal block  allocated  for  PSUs  of  Uttar  Pradesh,  Maharashtra  and  Chhattishgarh.  #
 *  There was  no  politics  in  de-allocation  process.  #
 *  The  de-allocation  is  done  by  a  committee.  #
 *  The  state  governments  allegation  of  favouring  other  states  do  not  arise  as  UP  and  Chhattisgarh  are  ruled  by  non-Congress  states,  the  minister  said  claiming  complete  transparency  in the  coal block  allotment  process.  #
 *  The  Aam  Aadmi  Party  has  demanded  the  setting  up  of  a  Special  Investigation  Team,  after  reports  that certain  Government  had  vetted  the  Central Bureau of  Investigations  status report  affecting the  Coalgate  scam  before  it  was  filed  in the  Supreme  Court.  #
 *  Demanding  resignation  of the  Union  Law Minister  for a  Attorney  General,  the  AAP  in  a  statement  said:  This  brazen  interference  in the  Coalgate  investigation  by  this  government,  an  investigation  being  currently  monitored  by the  Supreme  Court,  shows  the  desperation  of  this  government  and  requires  the  immediate  sacking  of the  Law Minister  for the  Attorney  General,  apart  from  officials  of the  Prime  Ministers  Office.  #
 *  In  fact,  it  requires  the  resignation  of the  Prime Minister  himself.  #
 *  In  any  case,  these  facts  make  out  an  unanswerable  case  for  an  independent  SIT  in the  Coalgate  scam.  #
 *  According  to  AAPs  spokesperson,  during  the  last  hearing  held  on  March  12  Prashant  Bhushan  had  made  the  plea  that  since  the  investigation  of the  Coalgate  scam  involves  inquiring  into  the  role  of the  Prime Minister  and  other  Cabinet  Ministers,  the CBI  would  not  be  able  to  investigate  it  independently  because  it  is  directly  controlled  by  them.  #
 *  The  petition  in the  case  has been  filed  by  Prashant  Bhushan  on  behalf  of the  Centre  for  Public  Interest  Litigation  for the  Common  Cause.  #
 *  All  this  shows  why  the  government  is  not  willing  to  let  go  of  their  control  of the  CBI  at  any  cost,  because  an  independent  CBI  under  an  independent  Lokpal  would  result  in  more  than  half  of the  present  Cabinet  going  to  jail,  the  spokesperson  said.  #
 *  Main  opposition  BJP  on  Monday  once  again  targeted  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  in  Lok Sabha  on  missing files  pertaining  to  coal  mines  allocation  saying  the  scam  is  monumental  and  demanded  that  he  clarify  on  it.  #
 *  Raising  the  issue  during  Zero  Hour,  Prakash  Javadekar  (BJP)  said  two  days  back  the  Prime Minister  said  he  was  not  the custodian of files  whereas  the  Opposition  believed  he  is  not  only  the custodian of files  but  also  the  custodian  of the  nation  but  not  performing  both  the  tasks  well.  #
 *  It is  a  monumental  scam  and  occurred  when  the  Prime Minister  was  the  Coal  Minister...PM  should  give  a  statement  on  this,  Mr.  #
 *  Javadekar  said,  demanding  to  know  whether  any  FIR  was  lodged  in the  missing files  issue  despite  the  Supreme Court  asking  for  it.  #
 *  Amid  attack  over  missing files  pertaining  to  allocation of coal  mines,  Prime Minister  had  on  August  30  said  in  Rajya  Sabha,  I  am  not  the custodian of files  in the  Coal  Ministry.  #
 *  Dissatisfied  with  the  reply,  Mr.  #
 *  Javadekar  launched  a  scathing  attack  affecting the  government  saying  it  is  doing  a  massive  cover  up  and  sought  Prime  Ministers  statement  on  it.  #
 *  He  said  unfortunately  the  Committee,  formed  by  coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal  included  a  Joint  Secretary  level  officer  who  is  charged  with  changing  the  files  with  the  CBI.  #
 *  This is  like  handing  over  the  keys  of the  treasury  to the  accused,  Mr.  #
 *  Javadekar  said  adding,  CBI  as  well  as a  Coal Ministry  has  said  before  PAC  (Public  Accounts  Committee)  that  all  important  files  are  missing...We  demand  dont  keep  such  people  who  were  instrumental  in  changing  the  files.  #
 *  As  he  said  that the  scam  has  smeared  the  face  of the  government  and  continued  to  target  Prime  Minister,  members  from  treasury  benches  countered  him  while  BJP  members  shouted  shame-shame{  .  #
 *  Ravi  Shankar  Prasad  (BJP)  joined  Mr.  #
 *  Javadekar  saying,  There was  a  discussion  on  it  but  Prime  Ministers  clarifications  are  pending.  #
 *  This is  a  monumental  scam.  #
 *  Mr.  #
 *  Prasad  said  the  Prime Minister  should  make  a  statement,  which  saw  Minister of State  Rajeev  Shukla  as  well  as  some  Congress  members  retorting  that  Dr.  #
 *  Singh  has  already  replied  twice  on the  issue.  #
 *  Deputy  Chairman  P.J.  #
 *  Kurien  interrupted  saying,  "It is  not  the  fault  of the  Prime  Minister.  #
 *  Prime Minister  had  come.  #
 *  However,  BJP  members  kept  shouting  slogans  like  PM  jawab  do  (PM  reply)  with  Purushottam  Khodabhia  Rupala  saying  the  party  will  continue  to  raise  the  issue  of  missing files  till  the  time  they  were  recovered.  #
 *  After  procedural  wrangles  were  ironed  out,  the  CBIs  probe  into  Coalgate  has  now  reached  the  Prime  Ministers  Office  (PMO)  and  its  officials.  #
 *  Investigators  have  recorded  statements  of  two  former  PMO  officials,  questioning  them  as  witnesses  in the  questionable  utilisation of coal  blocks,  sources  in the  CBI  said  on  Tuesday.  #
 *  Next  in  line,  they  indicated,  would  be  Prime  Ministers  Adviser  T.K.A.  #
 *  Nair,  whose  statement  would  be  recorded  as the  witness  in connection with  the  alleged irregularities in the  allocation  during  2006-09  when  Manmohan  Singh  himself  had  looked  after  the  Coal  Ministry.  #
 *  At  that  time,  Mr.  #
 *  Nair  served  him  as  Principal  Secretary.  #
 *  The CBI  questioned  two  mid-level  officials  Vini  Mahajan  and  Ashish  Gupta  who  were  posted  in the  PMO  during  2006-09.  #
 *  The CBI  has  also  summoned  the  former  Coal  Secretary,  H.C.  #
 *  Gupta,  as  an  accused.  #
 *  He  is believed to  be  a  crucial  link  in the  alleged  irregularities  when  the  Ministry  was  under  the  charge  of  Dr.  Singh.  #
 *  He  is free to  appear  before  the CBI  on  Thursday.  #
 *  As  Coal  Secretary,  Mr.  #
 *  Gupta  was  the  de-facto  chairman  of the  Screening Committee  that  allocated  coal  blocks,  the  sources  said.  #
 *  Earlier,  the  CBIs  efforts  to  question  Mr.  #
 *  Gupta  hit  a  dead-end  when  the  Ministry  of  Corporate  Affairs  nodal  ministry  for a  Competition  Commission  of  India,  of  which  member  he  was  till  last  week  denied  the  investigating  agency  permission.  #
 *  The CBI  has  to  file  a  progress  report  before  the  Supreme Court  on  July  10.  #
 *  "It is  probing  how  valuable  mining  rights  were  granted  at  throwaway  prices  to  companies  that  made  windfall  gains.  #
 *  The CBI  took  up  the  case  after  a  report  from  the  Comptroller and Auditor General  (CAG)  said  the  exchequer  suffered  a  revenue  loss  of  Rs.  #
 *  1.86  lakh  crore  through  the  allocation of coal blocks  to  select  companies.  #
 *  The CBI  has  so  far  registered  11  regular  cases.  #
 *  During  2006-09,  68  coal blocks  were  allotted  to  151  companies,  and the  files  relating  to  some  of  them  have  gone  missing.  #
 *  The CBI  registered  the  latest  FIR,  the  12th  in the  case,  earlier  this  month,  naming  Congress MP  and  industrialist  Naveen  Jindal  for the  former  minister of state for  Coal,  Dasari Narayan  Rao,  as  accused.  #
 *  The CBI  said  the  governments  screening  committee,  which  processed  applications  from  companies,  did  not  conduct  background  checks.  #
 *  It  also  questioned  the  working  of the  committee:  in  its  earlier  status report  submitted  to the  Supreme  Court,  it  had  said  the  allocations  during  2006-09  were  done  without  verification  of the  credentials  of the  companies  which  had  allegedly  misrepresented  facts  about  themselves.  #
 *  The  CAG,  too,  pointed  out  that the  Screening Committee  recommended  the  allocation of a coal block to  a  particular  company.  #
 *  However,  the  minutes  of the  meeting  that  made  the  decision  did  not  indicate  how  each  of the  applicants  was  evaluated.  #
 *  The  CAG  report  said  a  transparent  method  was  not  followed  by the  Screening Committee  for  allocation.  #
 *  Dropping  a  political  bombshell,  CBI Director Ranjit Sinha  on  Friday  told  the  Supreme Court  that the  agencys  status report  on  coal blocks allocation  scam  was  shared  with  Law Minister Ashwani Kumar  and  senior  officials  of  PMO  and  Coal  ministry  as desired by  them..  #
 *  Sinhas  two-page  affidavit  is  silent  on  whether  any  changes  were  made  in the  draft  report  after  it  was  shared  with  the  government  before  being  filed  in the  apex court  in  a  sealed  envelope.  #
 *  The  affidavit  assumes  importance  in the  wake  of  allegations  that certain  contents  of the  report  were  diluted  at  governments  behest.  #
 *  The  affidavit,  filed  affecting the  direction  of the  apex  court,  belies  the  claim  made  by  CBI  counsel  on the  last  date  of  hearing  that some  coalgate  scam  report  was  not  shared  with  any  member  of the  government.  #
 *  I  submit  that certain  draft  of the  same  (status  report)  was  shared  with  Law Minister  "as desired by  him  prior  to  its  submission  before  the  Supreme  Court.  #
 *  Besides  the  political  executive,  it  was  also  shared  with  one  joint  secretary  level  officer  each  of  Prime  Ministers  Office  and  Ministry  of  Coal  "as desired by  them,  the  affidavit  said.  #
 *  In  his  affidavit,  Sinha  assured  the  this court  that certain  agency  will  not  share  further  status  reports  in  this  case  with  any  member  of the  political  executive.  #
 *  He  also  said  that certain  latest  status report  being  filed  on  Friday  has  not  been  shared  with  any  political  executive  in  any  manner  whatsoever.  #
 *  I  confirm  that some  present  status report  being  filed  in  this court  has  not  been  shared  with  any  political  executive  in  any  manner  whatsoever.  #
 *  Directors  of the  five  private  companies  booked  by the  CBI  for  allegedly  furnishing  false  information  while  applying  for  coal blocks  will  soon  be  summoned  for  questioning  #
 *  The  Supreme Court  on  Monday  issued  notice  to the  Centre  and  the CBI  on  a  plea  and a  probe  by  a  special  investigation  team  into  the  alleged irregularities in the  coal block  allocations.  #
 *  It  sought  response  from  them  on  a  public  interest  litigation  petition  seeking  cancellation  of the  licenses  granted  by the  government  for  coal blocks  to  various  private  companies.  #
 *  The  bench,  however,  refused  to  stay  the  licenses,  which  were  allegedly  granted  in  violation  of  law.  #
 *  Some  Coal Ministry  officials  have been  quizzed  by the  Central Bureau of Investigation  in connection with  the  missing  coal block allocation  files.  #
 *  Having  registered  two  preliminary enquiry  in the  matter,  the CBI  summoned  the  Coal Ministry  officials  who  had  dealt  with  the  file,  which  have  now  disappeared  mysteriously.  #
 *  Some  of the  officials  produced  themselves  before  the  agency  for  clarifications,  whereas  some  are  yet  to be  examined.  #
 *  The CBI  is  probing  the  disappearance  to  ascertain  whether  the  files  were  deliberately  removed  to  destroy  evidence.  #
 *  The  preliminary enquiry  have been  registered  for the  periods  1993-2005  and  2006-09  in connection with  the  missing files  which  pertain  to  crucial  minutes  of the  25  for the  26  screening  committees  that  recommended  coal block  allocations.  #
 *  Some  of the  files  related  to the  applications  made  by  certain  top  corporate  houses  to  which  coal blocks  were  allotted.  #
 *  The  Coal Ministry  submitted  to the  CBI  on  Monday  a  detailed  report  affecting the  missing files  pertaining  to  coal block  allocations,  said  an  official.  #
 *  We  have  sent  the  report  to the  CBI  on  Monday,  a  Coal Ministry  official  said  on the  condition  of  anonymity.  #
 *  coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal  did  not  make  any  comment  on  whether  the  files  have been  dispatched.  #
 *  However,  he  said,  The  instructions  of the  Supreme Court  are  being  followed.  #
 *  When  asked  about  the  details  of the  report  that certain  ministry  has  sent  to  CBI,  the  official  said,  It is  a  confidential  correspondence  between  the CBI  and a  ministry.  #
 *  I  am  sorry  that  I  will  not  talk  about  it.  #
 *  When  asked  as  to  when  the  Ministry  will  file  complaint  with  regard  to the  missing  files,  he  said,  We  will  take  action  in  accordance  with  the  directions  of the  Supreme Court  and  as  per  the  law  and  within  the  timeline  which  has been  prescribed  for  us.  #
 *  Nearly  150  files  and  documents  were  to be  received  by the  CBI  from  the  Coal  Ministry.  #
 *  Senior  officials  attached  with  the  probe  had  yesterday  said  that  every  effort  was  made  by  CBI  to  locate  documents  and  files  that  were  seized  during  raids  earlier.  #
 *  While  hearing  the  case  on  August  29,  the  Supreme Court  had  directed  the CBI to give a list of documents,  files  and  information  sought  by  it  within  five  days  to the  Coal Ministry  which,  in  turn,  was  to  furnish  them  within  two  weeks.  #
 *  The agency in its  letter  dated  September  2  to  Attorney  General  G.E.  #
 *  Vahanvati  had  given  an  exhaustive  list  of  over  50  allocations,  the  files  of  which  have  not  been  received  by  it.  #
 *  The apex court had directed the Coal Ministry that if any document remains untraceable, then FIRs have to be lodged by the Coal Ministry with the CBI within a week  thereafter.  #
 *  Holding  that some  missing  documents  are  vital  for the  probe  in the  scam,  the  apex court  directed  the  Coal Ministry  to  lodge  complaint  with  the CBI  if  it  fails  to  trace  any  document  sought  by the  agency.  #
 *  BJP  demand  for the  Prime Minister's  resignation  over  coal block  allocations  and the  host  of  other  issues  on  Tuesday  stalled  Parliament  proceedings,  leading  to the  abrupt  adjournment  of the  Lok Sabha  without  transacting  any  business.  #
 *  Proceedings  were  also  disrupted  with  Samajwadi  Party  slamming  the  government  over  Chinese  incursions  in  Ladakh  and  Trinamool  Congress  accusing  the  Centre  of  treating  West  Bengal  in  a  step-motherly  manner.  #
 *  Rajya Sabha  witnessed  two  adjournments  till  2  PM,  while  the  Rajya Sabha  was  adjourned  and the  day  due  to  unabated  slogan-shouting  by  protesting  members  in the  Well.  #
 *  While  BJP  also  sought  sacking  of  Law Minister Ashwani Kumar  alleging  his  interference  in  preparation  of  CBI  report  to the  Supreme Court  on the  coal  scam,  DMK  sought  resignation  of  P  C  Chacko  as the  Chairman  of  Joint  Parliamentary  Committee  looking  into  the  2G  scam.  #
 *  At  one  point,  Yashwant  Sinha  of the  BJP  walked  up  to  DMK  leader  T  R  Baalu  and  had  some  discussion.  #
 *  As  Lok Sabha  reassembled  at  noon  after  the  first  adjournment,  members  of  BJP,  Trinamool  Congress,  SP  and  Left  parties  trooped  into  the  Well  raising  slogans  on  their  respective  demands.  #
 *  A  group  of  Congress  members  raised  vociferous  slogans  and  waved  placards  demanding  a  separate  Telangana  state.  #
 *  A  TDP  member  was  also  in the  Well  with  a  similar  placard.  #
 *  Left  members  raised  slogans  against  "state-sponsored  violence"  in  Mamata  Banerjee-ruled  West  Bengal.  #
 *  Slogan-shouting  DMK  members  were  also  in the  Well  as  former  Telecom  Minister  A  Raja  was  seen  standing  in the  aisle  and  Baalu  seeking  to  raise  the  Telecom  issue  in the  din.  #
 *  As  the  din  continued,  AIADMK  leader  M  Thambidurai  who  was  in the  Chair,  adjourned  the  House  and a  day.  #
 *  Similar  scenes  were  witnessed  in the  Lok Sabha  with  slogan  shouting  BJP  members  trooping  into  the  Well  demanding  Prime Minister's  resignation,  forcing  its  adjournment  first  till  noon  and  later  till  2  PM.  #
 *  Senior  CBI  officer  Vivek  Dutt,  who  headed  the  coalgate  scam  probe  team,  and  three  others  were  on  Friday  sent  to  three  days  in the  agencys  custody  by  a  Delhi  court  for  allegedly  taking  a  bribe  of  Rs.  #
 *  7  lakh  from  a  businessman  to  favour  him  in  a  land  dispute  case.  #
 *  Mr.  #
 *  Dutt,  a  Superintendent  of  Police,  CBI  inspector  Rajesh  Chandra  Karnatak,  alleged  middleman  Rajesh  Pachisia  and  businessman  Dinesh  Chand  Gupta  were  produced  before  the  court  where  CBI  sought  seven  days  police  custody  of the  four  accused.  #
 *  All  the  accused  are  remanded  in  CBI  custody  till  21  May,  Special  CBI  Judge  V.K.  #
 *  Gupta  said.  #
 *  Mr.  #
 *  Dutt,  however,  claimed  innocence  and  alleged  a  conspiracy  has been  hatched  to  keep  him  out  of the  Supreme  Court-monitored  coalgate  probe  team.  #
 *  During  the  hearing,  the CBI  prosecutor  told  the  court  that  Mr.  #
 *  Dutt  and  Karnatak  were  in the  same  branch  in the  agency  and  Mr.  #
 *  Pachisia  was  in  regular  contact  with  them.  #
 *  The CBI  said  Mr.  #
 *  Dinesh  Chand  Gupta  had  a  land  dispute  and a  cheating  case  was  registered  against  him  at  Amar  Colony  police  station  in  New  Delhi  and  Mr.  #
 *  Dutt  used  to  pressurise  the  Delhi  Police  officials,  who  were  investigating  the  cheating  case,  to  quash  the  FIR  and  for  this  he  had  demanded  Rs.  #
 *  15  lakh  from  Mr.  #
 *  Dinesh  Chand  Gupta.  #
 *  The sources said  the  SHO  of  Amar  Colony  police  station  was  initially  reluctant  but  later  he  succumbed  to the  pressure  for a  FIR  was  quashed.  #
 *  The CBI  said  Mr.  #
 *  Pachisia  was  apprehended  on  Friday  when  was  handing  over  Rs.  #
 *  7  lakh  to  Mr.  Karnatak.  #
 *  The  prosecutor  told  the  court  that  Rs.  #
 *  15  lakh  cash  was  recovered  from  Mr.  #
 *  Pachisia,  Mr.  #
 *  Karnatak  and  Mr.  #
 *  Dinesh  Chand  Gupta.  #
 *  Seeking  seven  days  custody  of the  four  accused,  the  prosecutor  also  said  that  during  the  searches  conducted  by the  agency,  Rs.  #
 *  24  lakh  cash  was  recovered  from  the  residence  of  Mr.  #
 *  Karnatak  on  Friday.  #
 *  Opposing  the  CBIs  plea  for  police  custody,  the  defence  counsel  said  Mr.  #
 *  Dutt  was  investigating  a  very  important  case  of  coalgate  scam  under  the  supervision  of the  Supreme Court  and  if  such  an  allegation  is  levelled  against  such  a  senior  official,  then  the  court  should  look  into  it  very  cautiously.  #
 *  Mr.  #
 *  Dutts  counsel  said  someone  was  trying  to  destroy  career  of the  senior  officer.  #
 *  The  doubt  which  we  have  in  our  mind  is  that  when  an  officer  is  involved  in  a  very  important  case,  then  someone  may  try  to  divert  the  attention.  #
 *  Someone  might  want  to  remove  him  from  the  probe,  the  counsel  said.  #
 *  He  told  the  court  that  his  client  is  being  targetted  and  nothing  has been  recovered  from  his  possession  by the  agency.  #
 *  He  is  investigating  an  important  case  under  the  supervision  of the  Supreme Court  and  somebody  wants  him  not  to be  the  part  of the  probe  team...  #
 *  This is  simply  a  device  to  divert  the  attention  that some  investigation  in the  coal  scam  is  vitiated  for a  officer  is  corrupt,  the  counsel  said.  #
 *  The  advocates,  appearing  and a  other  accused,  argued  the CBI  has  not  followed  proper  procedures  in  this  case  and  even  the  case  diary  is  not  proper.  #
 *  Countering  the  claims  of the  defence  counsel,  the CBI  said  they  have  done  the  investigating  in  a  fair  manner  and  no  injustice  is  being  done  to  anyone.  #
 *  Can  we  do  injustice  to  our  officer?...  #
 *  Cash  has been  recovered,  documents  have been  recovered  and  we  are  doing  it  in  a  fair  manner  and  no  injustice  is  being  done,  the  prosecutor  said.  #
 *  He  further  said  they  have  recorded  many  conversations  between  Mr.  #
 *  Dutt  for the  SHO  and  there  are  four  independent  witnesses  who  were  present  at  the  time  when  the  cash  was  recovered  from  the  possession  of the  accused.  #
 *  The  defence  counsel  also  alleged  the  arrest  of the  four  accused  was  illegal  as  they  were  arrested  at  7  p.m.  on  Friday  but  they  were  allowed  to  inform  their  families  only  at  1  a.m.  #
 *  The  advocate  said  the  maximum  sentence  and the  offence  of  conspiracy  under  the  IPC  and the  Prevention of Corruption  Act,  for  which  they  are  charged  with,  is  seven  years  and  in  such  a  situation,  reasons  for  arrest  have  to be  recorded,  which  has  not  been  done  in  this  case.  #
 *  Mr.  #
 *  Dutts  counsel  said  why  a  senior  CBI  officer  would  get  involved  in  a  dispute  between  two  private  parties.  #
 *  He  said  Mr.  #
 *  Dutt  is  being  targeted  as  there  is  no  direct  involvement  of the  CBIs  SP  and  nothing  has been  recovered  from  him.  #
 *  You  (CBI)  are  diluting  the  important  investigation  which  the  whole  country  is  seeing...You  are  diluting  the  probe  which  is being monitored by the  Supreme  Court,  the  counsel  said.  #
 *  The  agency  has  not  shown  the  complaint  of the  concerned  SHO  who  was  allegedly  pressurised,  he  said.  #
 *  He  also  said  the  facts  shows  that  it  was  not  a  trap  as  claimed  by  CBI.  #
 *  CBI  has  not  adhered  to  or  complied  with  any  of the  legal  and  legislative  requirements  expected  in  such  cases,  the  counsel  said.  #
 *  Tanmaya  Mehta,  one  of the  defence  counsel,  said  the  CBIs  investigating  officer  has  not  produced  the  case  diary  in  a  proper  form  and  they  have  curtailed  the  rights  of the  accused  after  arresting  them.  #
 *  Mr.  #
 *  Mehta  also  said  no  reason  for  arrest  has been  mentioned  in the  remand  application  submitted  in the  court  for  taking  the  accused  in  seven  days  police  custody.  #
 *  No  reason  to  take  police  custody  of the  accused  has been  given  in the  remand  application.  #
 *  Why  does  CBI  require  police  custody?  #
 *  Accused  are  ready  to  tell  this court  what  they  have  to  say,  Mr.  #
 *  Mehta  said.  #
 *  The CBI  prosecutor,  however,  argued  they  have  recovered  various  documents  and  some  cheques  which  they  want  to  verify.  #
 *  Regarding  the  arguments  by  Mr.  #
 *  Dutts  counsel  that  he  was  involved  in the  probe into the  coalgate  scam,  the  prosecutor  said  just  because  he  is  a  senior  CBI  officer  and  is  heading  the  probe  into  Coalgate,  does  it  mean  that  he  cant  do  anything  wrong?  #
 *  Do  we  want  to  arrest  out  officer  without  any  proof?  #
 *  We  are  also  pained  to  arrest  one  of  our  own  officers  and  we  will  not  do  any  injustice  to  him.  #
 *  We  have been  working  all  through  the  night,  with  the  officers  involved  not  even  taking  time  out  to  have  food  or  a  bath,  he  said.  #
 *  The CBI  said  the  arrest  took  place  on  Friday  night  between  9  to  9.30  p.m.  #
 *  The ED said  they  have  CD  recordings  allegedly  containing  their  conversations  and  CBI  need  time  to  verify  it.  #
 *  The  investigating  officer  told  the  court  that  sufficient  evidence  was  found  against  the  accused  and  thus  they  were  arrested.  #
 *  The  Bharatiya  Janata  Party  would  go  the  whole  hog  demanding  resignation  of the  Prime Minister Manmohan  Singh,  when  Parliament  resumes  its  sitting  on  Tuesday,  for  his  alleged  culpability  in  what  has been  named  as  coalgate  scam.  #
 *  The  BJPs  case  is  that  since  Dr.  #
 *  Singh  himself  presided  over  the  Coal Ministry  during  the  time  the  coal block  allocations  were  made,  resulting  in  presumptive  loss  of  Rs.  #
 *  1.86  lakh  crore  to the  exchequer,  he  cannot  pass  the  buck.  #
 *  Some  quarters  in the  party  suggested  that  a  privilege  motion  could  be  moved  against  Minister of state for  Personnel  V.  #
 *  Narayanasamy  for  his  reported  comments  against  the  Comptroller and Auditor General  (CAG).  #
 *  However,  a  senior  leader  said  that  at  this  stage  the  party  would  focus  exclusively  affecting the  Prime  Minister.  #
 *  The  party  has  already  gathered  plenty  of  material  on the  coal block  allocations  and  it  was  affecting the  basis  of the  evidence  the  party  MP  Prakash  Javdekar  had  petitioned  the  Central  Vigilance  Commission  (CVC),  seeking  a  probe into the  issue.  #
 *  The  CVC  has  already  asked  the CBI  to  look  into  the  alleged  losses  suffered  by the  exchequer  in  utilisation of coal blocks  between 2006 and  2009.  #
 *  A  CAG  report  tabled  in  Parliament  is  referred  to the  Public  Accounts  Committee  for  examination  and  comments  and  since  the  body  has  representation  of  all  parties,  normally  the  issue  can  not  be  raised  till  the  PAC  submits  its  report.However,  the  BJPs  contention  is  that  much  of the  material  presented  by the  CAG  is  in  public  domain  for the  conclusions  drawn  by the  CAG  report  justify  raising  the  subject  in  Parliament.  #
 *  Even  as a  Supreme Court  is  chiding  the  Central Bureau of Investigation  over  shoddy  investigation  in the  multi-crore  coal  scam  and  unruly  scenes  becoming  a  regular  feature  at  the  ongoing  Parliament  session  over  the  same  issue,  a  documentary  released  in the  Capital  recently  questioned  the  countrys  over-reliance  on  coal  as a  power  generator  and  its  various  negative  consequences.  #
 *  Journalist  Paranjoy  Guha  Thakurtas  documentary  film  Coal  Curse  is  a  43-minute  expose  of the  political  economy  of  coal  in  contemporary  India,  focusing  affecting the  issue  of  corruption  as  exposed  by the  Coalgate  scam.  #
 *  It  then  moves  on  to  observe  the  micro-level  consequences  of  coal  mining  in the  Singrauli  region  in  Central  India,  telling  the  story  of  displacement,  devastation  and  despair.  #
 *  It  questions  the  glaring  paradox  in  Indias  electricity  hub,  Singrauli,  from  where  big  cities  like  Delhi  draw  close  to  15  per cent  of  their  electricity  needs.  #
 *  Coal  is  basic  to the  working  of the  economy  but  it  comes  at  a  grave  cost  and a  consequences  of  coal  mining  can  be  seen  in  Singrauli  where  the  livelihoods  of  many,  especially  those  belonging  to  indigenous  tribal  communities  have been  irreparably  damaged  by  coal  mining.  #
 *  Singrauli  as  it  exists  today  has  become  a  metaphor  for  much  of  what  has  gone  wrong  with  Indias  development  paradigm,  says  Mr.  Thakurta.  #
 *  A  debate  affecting the  issue  of  corruption  followed  the  screening  of the  film.  #
 *  Former  Coal Secretary  P.C.  #
 *  Parakh,  considered  as the  whistleblower  of the  Coalgate  scam,  said  during  his  tenure  as the  Coal  Secretary,  he  had  made  the  proposal  and the  transparent  bidding  system  for  allocation  of the  coal blocks  and  Prime Minister Manmohan  Singh,  as the  then  Union  minister of  Coal,  approved  it.  #
 *  However,  both  the  then  Ministers  of  State  for  Coal  Dasari Narayana  Rao  and  then  Shibu  Soren  (who  subsequently  returned  as the  Cabinet  Minister)  were  not  in favour of  open  bidding  and  repeatedly  tried  to  scuttle  the  proposal.  In  my  view,  there  was  an  attempt  to  keep  the  bidding  system  in  suspended  animation  till  all  the  good  blocks  have been  allocated  and  nothing  worthwhile  is  left  to be  given  through  bidding,  he  remarked.  #
 *  Energy  solutions  were  also  discussed  by the  panellists  highlighting  the  fact  that some  primary  roadblock  impeding  investments  of  scale  in the  renewable  energy  sector  is  a  serious  policy  lacuna,  rather  than  technical  issues.  #
 *  The  point  that some  important  role  of  energy  efficiency  in  bringing  down  the  demand  for  coal  has been  left  largely  unexplored  by the  government  was  also  raised  during  the  debate.  #
 *  Former  Union  Power  Minister  Suresh  Prabhu,  former  Secretary  to  Finance  and  Power  Ministries  EAS  Sarma,  lawyer-activist  Prashant  Bhushan,  former  Advisor  to  Planning  Commission  Shekhar  Singh,  head  of the  Climate  and  Energy  campaign  in  Greenpeace  India  Vinuta  Gopal  were  part  of the  panel  discussion.  #
 *  The  country  is  poised  at  a  juncture  where  it  can  make  a  choice  affecting the  type  of  energy  infrastructure  it  wants  to  invest  in  and a  future.  #
 *  The  era  of  cheap  coal  is  over.  #
 *  With  renewable  energy  prices  dropping  and the  price  of  coal  constantly  affecting the  rise,  the  differences  between  the  two  are  quickly  evening  out.  #
 *  Aiming  to  achieve  its  twin  objective  of  providing  energy  access  to  over  300  million  people  who  have  no  access  to  electricity  and  to  sustain  its  long-term  economic  growth  aspiration,  India  needs  to  diversify  its  energy  generation  by  mainstreaming  renewable  energy  combined  with  energy  efficiency  measures.  #
 *  Given  the  energy  security  and  energy  independence  that  only  renewable  energy  can  offer  us,  for a  destruction  that  coal  mining  wreaks,  the  answer  seems  obvious,  Arundhati  Muthu,  climate  and  energy  campaigner,  Greenpeace  India  said.  #
 *  The  Central Bureau of Investigation  (CBI)  may  question  Odisha  Chief  Minister  Naveen  Patnaik  regarding  utilisation of coal blocks  to  Aditya Birla  groups  Hindalco.  #
 *  CBI  officials,  however,  said  a  decision  to  this  effect  is  yet  to be  taken.  #
 *  They said  Patnaik  could  be  questioned  if  there  was  a  need  to  know  why  he  recommended  Hindalco  for a  coal  blocks.  #
 *  Sources  said  Patnaik  had  recommended  a  re-look  into  the  25th  screening  committees  decision  to  deny  coal blocks  to  Hindalco  in  2005.  #
 *  Former  coal  secretary  P  C  Parakh  kicked  up  a  political  storm  with  his  comment  that  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  should  also  be  booked  since  it  was  he  who  finally  decided  to  reverse  the  committees  decision  and  allot  coal blocks  to  Hindalco.  #
 *  CBI sources said  the  agency  would  question  Birla  and  Parakh,  but  it  could  take  some  time  as  it  first  wanted  to  examine  documents  to  gather  material  evidence.  #
 *  The  agency  named  people  in the  FIR  on the basis of  prima facie  evidence,  they  said.  #
 *  CBI Director Ranjit Sinha  said  the  case  was  being  monitored  by the  Supreme  Court.  #
 *  All  details  will  be  provided  in  a  status  report,  to be  filed  later  this  month.  We  registered  the  FIR  affecting the basis of  available  material  during  preliminary  enquiry.  #
 *  Further  evidence  would  be  gathered  during  further  probe,  he  said.  #
 *  V  Narayanasamy,  Minister of state  in the  Prime Minister's  Office,  said  the  government  had  nothing  to  hide.  #
 *  The  coal blocks  were  allotted  to  public  and  private  sector  companies  on the basis of  recommendations  of  states.  We  have  made  it  very  clear  that certain  allocations  were  made  to  public  sector  undertakings  and  also  some  private  companies  on  recommendations  of  state  governments,  he  said.  #
 *  Narayanasamy,  who  is  in  charge  of the  Ministry  of  Personnel,  which  handles  the  investigating  agency,  said  the  committee  comprised  chief  secretaries  of the  states  where  coal blocks  were  available.  #
 *  He,  however,  did  not  comment  on  Parakhs  jibe  at  the  prime  minister.  #
 *  The CBI  also  claimed  to  have  made  a  fresh  recovery  from  Aditya Birla  group,  including  retail  invoice  of  gold  coins  to the  tune  of  Rs  94  lakh,  investments  in  various  schemes  to the  tune  of  Rs  17  lakh  and  Rs  24  lakh  petty  cash.  #
 *  The  agency  has  already  handed  over  to the  Income  Tax  department  Rs 25 crore  which  was  recovered  on  Tuesday  in  a  raid  at  Hindalcos  New  Delhi  office.  #
 *  The  Bharatiya  Janata  Party  on  Wednesday  renewed  its  demand  for the  resignation  of the  Prime Minister  stating  that  Manmohan  Singh  cannot  escape  responsibility  for  having  signed  the  contract  for a  allotment  of  coal blocks  to the  Kumar  Mangalam  Birla-owned  Hindalco.  #
 *  The  opposition  partys  call  came  in the  wake  of  a  remark  by  former coal secretary  P  C  Parakh,  a  whistleblower-turned-accused  in the  case,  that some  prime  minister  should  be  made  a  co-accused  if  the CBI  has  booked  him  for  favouring  an  industrialist  in  giving  contracts.  #
 *  "Today,  a  surprising  development  has  taken  place  where,  in  a  bizarre  instance,  an  FIR  has been  lodged  against  the  officer  who  suggested  that certain  auction  route  should  be  adopted  in  coal block  allocations  and  even  prepared  a  Cabinet  note  on  it,"  BJP  spokesperson  Prakash  Javadekar  told  reporters.  #
 *  The  BJP  was  of the  view  that  had  the  UPA  government  agreed  to  Parakhs  2004  proposal  the  scam  would  not  have  happened.  #
 *  But  the  Singh  government  held  back  the  Cabinet  note  to  allow  the  arbitrary  allotment  of  coal  blocks,  it  believes.  #
 *  Right  from  day  one,  the  BJP  has been  demanding  the  resignation  of  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  as  he  was  the  then  Coal  Minister  under  whose  signature  and  seal  the  monumental  scam  happened.  #
 *  In  the  bizarre  allotment,  neither  the  state  exchequer  got  any  benefit  nor  did  the  ultimate  consumer  receive  any  benefit  by  way  of  cheap  power.  #
 *  The  only  beneficiary  seems  to be  the  ruling  party.  #
 *  This is  the  monumental  corruption  which  the  Congress-led  government  is  desperately  trying  now  to  cover  up,  the  BJP  MP  charged.  #
 *  The  BJP  wanted  to  know  why  no  action  was  being  taken  against  the  PM?who  had  signed  the  contract  papers  when,  in the  Commonwealth  Games  scam,  the  final  signatory  was  held  accountable.  #
 *  The  BJP  also  targeted  the CBI  for  adopting  a  selective  probe  in the  case.  #
 *  The  party  wanted  to  know  why  former  minister of State for  Coal  Dasari Narayan  Rao,  who  is  an investor in the  one  of the  Coalgate  cases,  was  not  even  questioned.  #
 *  "The  Supreme Court  had  called  CBI  a  caged  parrot.  #
 *  In  Railgate,  it  had  made  the  one  who  committed  the  scam  a  witness,"  Javadekar  said,  accusing  the CBI  of  sparing  the  real  culprits  in the  scam.  #
 *  While  the  UPA  ministers  have been  defending  business  magnate  Kumar Mangalam Birla  the  BJP  has  come  to the  defence  of  Parakh.  #
 *  The  Left  has  demanded  a  speedy  probe  but  is  not  satisfied  with  the  way  the  PM  has  handled  the  Coalgate  scandal.  #
 *  The  Central Bureau of Investigation  (CBI)  has  booked  cases  against  Aditya Birla  Group  chairman  Kumar Mangalam Birla  and  former coal secretary  P  C  Parekh  on  charges  of  criminal conspiracy  and  corruption  in the  multi-crore  coal block allocation  scam.  #
 *  This is  the  14th  case  in the  controversial  allocation  that  rocked  the  country.  #
 *  After  registering  the  fresh  FIR,  the CBI  conducted  searches  at  six locations in Mumbai,  Delhi, Hyderabad and  Bhubaneshwar  and a  residence  of  Parekh  in  Secunderabad.  #
 *  Birla  is  the  second  prominent  businessman  to be  named  in  an  FIR  after  Congress MP  Naveen  Jindal,  who  is  also  an  industrialist.  #
 *  Birla  has been  booked  as a  representative  of  Aditya Birla  Group  and  his  group  company  Hindalco,  an  aluminium  maker,  for  alleged  corruption  in the  allocation of  two  coal blocks  in  Talabira  in  Odisha,  which  was  allotted  to  it  on  November  10,  2005,  senior  CBI  officials  said.  #
 *  Birla  may  be  called  in  for  questioning  soon,  officials  said.  #
 *  During  2005,  according  to  a  statement  issued  by the  CBI,  the  said  persons  in  criminal conspiracy  with  one  another  and  then  public  servants  by  abusing  their  positions  as  such  showed  undue  favour  to  an  Odisha-based  industry  in  allocation of  Talabira II  and  Talabira  III  coal blocks  along  with  a  Public  Sector  Undertaking  of  Tamil  Nadu.  #
 *  The  coal blocks  were  allocated  for  power  production.  #
 *  The  officials  said  Hindalco  did  not  fulfil  requirements  of  coal block  but  was  unduly  favoured  by the  government.  #
 *  The  block  was  meant  for  PSUs  only  but  a  decision  was  taken  in favour of  Hindalco  after  Birla  had  a meeting with  Parekh,  they  said.  #
 *  The  Birla  Group  has  refuted  the  allegations  of  any  wrongdoing.  This  relates  to  media  reports  on  an FIR naming Hindalco and  our  chairman  on the  coal  issue.  #
 *  Apparently, this seems to be part of a larger case entailing coal allocation to companies, and being one of the companies, we are being investigated  also.  #
 *  "We wish to state unambiguously that we have followed every process required for allocation of coal completely, as stipulated by the  government  policy,  a  statement  issued  by  Hindalco  said.  #
 *  The  FIR  registered  by the  CBI  has  said  that  Neyveli  Lignite  Limited  was  to be  given  Talabira II  block  but  Parekh  allegedly  favoured  Hindalco  and  allowed  it  to  share  the  block  with  Neyveli.  #
 *  The CBI  could  not  calculate  the  loss  to  exchequer  as a  coal block  is  still  not  operational.Investigators  said  the CBI  is  investigating  the  quid pro  quo  between  Birla  and  Parekh.  #
 *  The  undue  favours  shown  to the  Birlas  resulted  in  loss  to the  exchequer.  #
 *  While  this  case  is  the  first  to be  registered  in connection with  allocations  between  1993  and  2005,  the  previous  13  FIRs  registered  by the  agency  were  from  the  enquiry,  which  looked  into  allocations  made  during  the  period  2006-09  when  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  was  in  charge  of the  Coal  Ministry.  #
 *  The  Centre  and  the CBI  have been  rebuked  by  Supreme Court  for  its  handling  of the  case.  #
 *  The  missing files  for the  alleged  non-cooperation  of the  Coal Ministry  had  been  deliberated  by the  Supreme Court  during  the  hearing  of the  case.  #
 *  The  UPA  government  may  be  subject  to  major  embarrassment  in connection with  the  coal blocks  allotment  scam  as the  Central Bureau of Investigation  is expected to  inform  the  Supreme Court  that some  status report  it  submitted  last  month  was  vetted  by  Law Minister Ashwani Kumar  and  officials  of  PMO.  #
 *  At  least  five  crucial  files  related  to  allotment  of  coal blocks  during  2006-09  have  not  been  received  by  CBI  which  has  again  communicated  to the  Coal Ministry  to  make  them  available  as  soon  as  possible.  #
 *  CBI sources said  despite  being  given  the  specifics  of the  files  they  are  yet  to be  furnished  to the  agency  to  expedite  the  probe  in the  coal blocks allocation  scam.  #
 *  The  agency  has  so  far  registered  13  cases  related  to  allotment  of  coal blocks  during  the  period  2006-09  for  alleged  misrepresentation  of  facts  by the  beneficiaries  while  applying  of the  blocks.  #
 *  The ED said  they  are  planning  to  register  more  cases  in connection with  its  preliminary enquiry  which  relates  to  alleged irregularities in the  allocation of coal blocks  during  the  period.  #
 *  The  Ministry  had  recently  informed  a  Parliamentary  committee  that  it  is  trying  to  locate  lost  and  missing files  on  coal block allocation  in the  wake  of  Supreme Court  slamming  the  Centre  for  not  helping  CBI  with  documents  in  its  probe.  #
 *  The  sources  in  CBI  said  they  had  received  a  letter  from  Coal Secretary  S  K  Srivastava  addressed  to the  Director  CBI  seeking  details  of the  files  which  it  requires  for  its  probe.  #
 *  They said  they  would  again  be  giving  details  of the  files  soon  to the  Ministry.  #
 *  The  agency  is  facing  another  problem  with  regards  to  its  separate  enquiry  in the  coal blocks  allocated  through  Joint  Venture  routes  as  19  of the  20  state  governments  it  approached  have  not  given  their  consent  to  probe  the  irregularities.  #
 *  In  its  status report  filed  on  March  8  before  the  Supreme  Court,  the CBI  had  said  that some  coal blocks allocation  during  2006-09  was  done  without  verifying  the  credentials  of  companies  which  allegedly  misrepresented  facts  about  themselves  and  no  rationale  was  given  by the  Coal Ministry  in  giving  coal blocks  to  them.  #
 *  Former  Minister of state for  coal  Dasari Narayana  Rao  and  Congress MP  Naveen  Jindal  were  booked  by the  CBI  on  charges  of  cheating,  graft  and  criminal  misconduct  in the  coal  allotment  scam.  #
 *  The company, in its  FIR,  alleged  that  Rao  accepted  Rs  2.25  crore  investment  in  one  of  his  firms  which  it  suspects  to be  a  bribe  from  industrialist-cum-politician  Jindals  company  as the  transaction  happened  after  he  got  a  coal block  in the  Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block  in  Birbhum,  Jharkhand,  in  2008.  #
 *  The CBI  accused  two  Jindal  firmsJindal  Steel  and  Power  Limited  (JSPL)  and  Gagan Sponge Iron  Limitedof  getting  Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block  by  misrepresenting  facts  when  Rao  was  the  minister of State for  coal.  #
 *  Rao  has  already  been  questioned  by the  CBI  in  this  regard.  #
 *  Agency  officials  also  searched  to  gather  evidence  needed  to  substantiate  their  allegations  against  the  Congress  leaders.  #
 *  The  agency  team  carried out  coordinated  searches  at  the  6  Prithviraj  Road  residence  of  Jindal  and  offices  of  his  firms  in  Bikaji  Cama  Place.  #
 *  Apart  from  that,  the  sleuths  also  landed  at  the  Telugu  filmmaker-turned-politicians  house  in the  Jubilee  Hills  in  Hyderabad.  #
 *  Rao  was  not  available  for  comments  to  media  gathered  outside  his  house.  #
 *  CBI  sources  alleged  that  Jindal  firms  had  tweaked  facts  on  land,  water  supply  and  previous  allocations  so  that  they  could  become  eligible  for  getting  another  block  for  mining.  #
 *  JSPL  is  accused  of  not  disclosing  in  application  form  submitted  in  January  2007  that  they  actually  had  at  least  six  blocks.  #
 *  Instead,  they  wrote  they  had  only  three  coal  blocks.  #
 *  This  was  a  move,  said  CBI  sources,  to  offset  the  possible  government  attempt  of  rejecting  their  case  affecting the  grounds  of  avoiding  monopoly  of  single  company.  #
 *  In  less  than  a  year,  the  Coal Ministry  allocated  a  block  to  JSPL  in  January  2008.  #
 *  Interestingly,  around  the  same  time  Jindals  company  New  Delhi  Exim  also  bought  shares  of  Rao's  firm  Saubhagya  Media,  listed  at  Rs  28  that  year,  at  a  whopping  Rs  100  per  share.  #
 *  Through  this  route,  Congress  MPs  firm  invested  nearly  Rs  2.25  crore.  #
 *  New  Delhi  Exims  account  books  showed  investments  as  loans  from  Jindal  Realty,  which  in  turn  had  received  the  money  as  loan  from  Gagan Sponge Iron  Limited  to  show  it  to be  a  genuine  investment.  #
 *  JSPL  Head  of  External  Affairs  Manu  Kapoor  said  in  a  statement:  JSPL,  as the  law-abiding  company, is governed by a strong ethical code of  conduct.  #
 *  This is an ongoing CBI investigation into  coal block  allocation.  #
 *  At this stage of investigation, JSPL is committed to fully cooperate with  the  CBI.  #
 *  Union  Home  Minister  Sushilkumar  Shinde  avoided  giving  reaction  on  the CBI  naming  Jindal  and  Rao  in  their  FIR  in  coalgate,  saying  law  will  take  its  course.  #
 *  It is  their  (CBI)  job.  #
 *  I  will  not  give  my  comment.  #
 *  It  doesn't  matter.  #
 *  Whatever  position,  if  he  (Jindal)  is  involved,  according  to  law  they  should  proceeded,  Shinde.  #
 *  Terming  the CBI  raids  as  too  little  and  too  late,  BJP  spokesperson  Prakash  Javdekar  has  asked  the  agency  to  trace  the  money  trail  in  this  case.  #
 *  CBI  today  opened  cupboards  of  Congress MP  Naveen  Jindal,  who  returned  last  night  from  abroad,  after  he  was  asked  to  join  its  probe  in the  allocation of a coal block to  his  company  Jindal  Steel  and  Power  Ltd.  #
 *  During  the  searches  conducted  on  June  11,  CBI  was  unable  to  complete  its  operation  at  Jindal's  6-Prithviraj  Road  residence  here  as  some  of the  cupboards and almirahs  were  locked  and  they  could  only  be  unlocked  by the  MP  who  was  out  with  his  family  at  that  time.  #
 *  CBI sources said  that  a  search  team  went  to  his  residence  this  morning  and  searched  the  cupboards and almirahs  in the  presence  of  Jindal,  who  has been  named  in  its  FIR  along  with  former  Minister of State for  Coal  D  Narayan  Rao  for  alleged  cheating and  graft.  #
 *  CBI  had  communicated  to  Jindal  to  join  the  probe  as  soon  as  possible  since  these  cupboards and almirahs  could  be  opened  only  after  his  arrival.  #
 *  According  to the  FIR,  JSPL  and  Gagan Sponge Iron  Ltd,  also  a  firm  belonging  to  Jindal,  had  bagged  Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block  in  Jharkhand  in  2008  by  alleged  misrepresentation  of  facts  when  Rao  was  the  Minister of state for  Coal.  #
 *  Within  a  year,  a  block  was  allocated  to  JSPL  in  January  2008,  CBI  sources  claimed,  noting  that  shares  of  Rao's  firm  Saubhagya  Media  listed  at  Rs  28  that  time  were  purchased  by  one  of  Jindal's  firm  --  New  Delhi  Exim  Ltd  --  at  a  whopping  Rs  100  per  share  with  total  investment  of  nearly  Rs  2.25  crore  which  is  alleged  to be  illegal  gratification.  #
 *  Head  of  External  Affairs  at  JSPL,  Manu  Kapoor  had  earlier  said,  "JSPL,  as the  law  abiding  company, is governed by a strong ethical code of  conduct.  #
 *  This is an ongoing CBI investigation into  coal block  allocation.  #
 *  At this stage of investigation, JSPL is committed to fully cooperating with  CBI."  #
 *  CBI  claimed  that  JSPL  submitted  in  January,  2007  that  they  had  only  three  coal blocks  with  them  whereas  actually  they  had  at  least  six  coal  blocks.  #
 *  The sources said  this  was  done  to  boost  their  eligibility  and the  Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block  as a  government  was  mulling  to  avoid  monopoly  of  a  single  company  by  not  allocating  large  number  of  blocks  to  a  single  firm.  #
 *  They said  in the  account  books  of  New  Delhi  Exim,  the  said  money  was  shown  as  loans  from  Jindal  Realty  which  in  turn  had  received  the  money  as  loan  from  Gagan Sponge Iron  Ltd  to  show  it  as a  genuine  investment.  #
 *  Besides  Jindal  and  Rao,  CBI  has  also  booked  companies  Jindal  Steel  and  Power  Ltd,  Gagan Sponge Iron  Ltd,  Jindal  Realty  and  ND  Exim  and  Rao's  company  Saubhagya  Media.  #
 *  The  Supreme Court  today  pulled  up  CBI,  PMO  and  Coal Ministry  officials  for  changing  the scope of the coal scam  probe  report  and  directed  the  governments  to  come  out  with  a  law  before  July  10  to  insulate  the  agency  "external  influence  and  intrusion".  #
 *  Even  as  it  came  down  heavily  on  these  entities,  the  this court  also  made  a  reference  to the  Union  Law Minister  Aswan  Kumar's  role  in  vetting  the  probe  report  and  asked,  "does  it  not  subvert  the  integrity  of the  investigation  if  changes  are  brought  in  status report  affecting the  suggestion  of  Law Minister  and  government  officers."  #
 *  However,  this  apart,  there  were  no  strong  observations  against  Kumar,  who  is  battling  to  retain  his  position  in the  Cabinet,  with  the  opposition  demanding  that  he  resign  for  vetting  the  draft  report  of the  CBI  to the  Supreme  Court.  #
 *  The  Bench  wanted  to  know  whether  the  Law Minister  can  ask  CBI  to  show  details  of  probe  or  status report  in  a  case  involving  people  of  other  ministries  for the  PMO.  #
 *  During  the  three-hour  long  hearing,  the  bench  was  critical  of the  access  given  by the  CBI  to  Shatrughna  Singh  and  A  K  Bhalla,  joint  secretaries  of  PMO  for a  Coal Ministry  respectively,  to the  draft  probe  reports.  #
 *  "What  business  they  (JS  of  PMO  and  Coal  Ministry)  have  to  go  to  CBI  and  look  the  draft  status  report.  #
 *  What  business  they  have  on  earth  to  go  to  CBI  to  see  draft  status  report?  #
 *  "How  can  CBI  permit  them  to  peruse.  #
 *  Whether  they  took  away  draft  report  with  them  or  not.  next  day,  these  people  came  and  suggested  changes  in  para  1.21.  #
 *  PE  2  is  the  most  crucial.  #
 *  "These  two  gentlemen  visit  the CBI  office  and  they  were  shown  the  draft  reports  on  March  6.  #
 *  They  go  back  and  on  March  7,  come  back  and  say  changes  have  to be  done  in  two  paragraphs,"  the  bench  said  adding  "This  is  something  which  is  very  serious".  #
 *  The  bench,  also  comprising  justices  Madan  B  Lokur  and  Kurian  Joseph,  said  the  agency  should  stand  up  to  all  kinds  of  "pulls  and  pressures"  and  not  share  its  probe  report.  #
 *  "You  (CBI)  are  not  applying  your  mind  in  such  an  important  and  sensitive  case.  #
 *  There  are  pulls  and  pressures  from  all  quarters.  #
 *  You  should  have  the  capability  to  stand  the  pulls  and  pressures.  #
 *  "Supreme  Court  has  given  you  strength  15  years  ago  (Vineet  Narain  case).  #
 *  You  should  make  yourself  solid  as the  rock  but  you  are  like  the  sand.  #
 *  We  want  a  very  professional,  very  qualitative,  very  thorough  investigation,"  the  court  said.  #
 *  The  bench,  which  accused  the  political  executives  for the  officials  of  changing  the  heart  of the  probe  reports,  also  said  that  as a  result  the  "whole  direction"  of the  investigation  got  changed.  #
 *  "You  could  have  said  it  earlier  which  is  said  now  only.  #
 *  A  different  impression  has  come  out.  #
 *  This is  the  position  of the  premier  investigating  agency  in  which  we  all  take  pride.  #
 *  "The  CBI  should  have  stood  up  and  denied  the  invasion,  intrusion  and  incursion.  #
 *  It is  a  total  act  of  indiscretion.  #
 *  The CBI  director  said  in  an  unequivocal  term  that  changes  were  made  in  para  19  and  they  were  of  significant  natures.  #
 *  "The  entire  direction  of  investigation  has  changed.  #
 *  Now  the  investigation  has  gone  in  a  particular  direction,"  it  said.  #
 *  The  court  termed  as  "sordid  saga"  the  sharing  and  alterations  in  draft  probe  reports  and  said  the CBI  has  become  a  "caged  parrot"  which  is  speaking  in the  voice  of  its  political  masters.  #
 *  "...CBI  has  become  a  caged  parrot.  #
 *  We  can't  have  CBI  a  caged  parrot  speaking  in  master's  voice.  #
 *  It is  a  sordid  saga  where  there  are  many  masters  and  one  parrot,"  the  bench  said.  #
 *  It  also  took  strong  note  of the  transfer  of  Ravikant  Mishra,  the  then  CBI  DIG  who  was  in-charge  of  coalgate  probe,  to the  Intelligence  Bureau  and  asked  the  Government  not  only  to  repatriate  him  back  but  also  not  to  disturb  the  33-member  probe  team  without  its  prior  approval.  #
 *  "Immediate  steps  should  be  taken  by  Centre  and  CBI  to  repatriate  Ravikant  Mishra,  back  with  CBI  for  inquiry,  investigation  in  coal block allocation  case.  #
 *  Director  CBI  shall  ensure  that  33  officials,  including  Mishra,  are  not  changed  without  the  permission  of  this  court,"  the  bench  said.  #
 *  The  court,  at  the  end  of the  hearing,  passed  a  slew  of  directions  and  asked  the CBI  and the  Centre  to  file  affidavits.  #
 *  "Henceforth,  Director  CBI  shall  ensure  that  in the  investigation  of  utilisation of coal  blocks,  no  access  of  any  nature  is  provided  to  any  person,  authority  including  ministers,  Law Minister  or  any  other  central  minister,  law  officers,  counsel  of  CBI,  department  of  Prosecution,CBI  or  any  person  or  any  officer  of  central  government  or  any  person  outside  the  investigating  team,"  the  order  said.  #
 *  It  also  made  it  clear  that  no  court  except  the  this court  will  be  given  the  status report  filed  so  far.  #
 *  The  bench  also  sought  to  know  from  the  Government  and  the CBI  as  to  whether  the  Law Minister  has  the  power  to  see  the  investigation  report.  #
 *  "Minister  is  answerable  to  Parliament  but  the  minister  cannot  intervene  in the  investigation...After  going  through  the  affidavit  filed  by the  director,  there  are  certain  questions  which  require  some  debate.  #
 *  The  question  is  whether  any  person/  authority  or  Law Minister  has  any  power  under  Rule  of  Business  to  share  the  report,"  it  said.  #
 *  The  admission  of  CBI Director Ranjit Sinha  that  agency  officials  interact  with  government  officials  regularly  drew  the  ire  of the  apex court  which  said  that some  job  of the  agency  is  to  interrogate  and  not  to  interact  with  officials  of  suspect  ministry.  #
 *  "Does  CBI  interact  or  interrogate?  #
 *  Is  it  some  collaborative  effort?  #
 *  There is  no  question  of  interaction.  #
 *  The  question  is  that  you  seek  some  information  for a  ministry  and the  department  is  bound  to  supply  documents.  #
 *  There was  no  question  of  interaction  but  interrogation,"  the  bench  said.  #
 *  Attorney  General  G E  Vahanvati,  who  has been  under  fire  recently  after  CBI  Director  and  former  ASG  Haren  Raval  belied  his  assertion  that  he  had  not  seen  the CBI  report,  today  tried  hard  to  justify  his  stand.  #
 *  "I  have been  defamed,  attacked  and the  lot  of  things  have been  said  about  me.  #
 *  I  have  to  point  out  that  till  September  2012,  I  was  not  in the  matter.  #
 *  I  came  only  in  November  and  asked  for a  time  to  file  the  affidavit.  #
 *  I  had  said  that  I  had  not  seen  the  draft  status  report,"  he  said.  #
 *  Responding  to  his  statement,  Justice  Lodha  said,  "You  may  not  have been  wrong  but  at  the  same  time  you  should  have  explained  everything".  #
 *  At  the  very  beginning  of the  hearing,  advocate  M  L  Sharma  sought  prosecution  of  AG  and  Raval  for the  offence  of  perjury,  accusing  them  of  making  false  statements  in  judicial  proceedings  that  too  before  the  this court  hearing  the  sensitive  case.  #
 *  The  court,  however,  told  Prashant  Bhushan,  who  raised  a  similar  plea,  that  this  aspect  would  be  taken  up  later  as  right  now  the  bench  was  on the  issue  of  probe  in the  sensitive  case.  #
 *  The  multi-crore  coal  scam  has  cast  a  shadow  on  ambitious  project  of the  State  government  to  convert  a  stretch  of  a  State  highway  into  concrete  road  under  public  private  partnership  (PPP).  #
 *  Abhijit  Infrastructure,  the  promoter  of the  Karnataka  Road  Development  Corporation  Limiteds  (KRDCL)  Hassan-Chikkanayakanahalli  highway  development  project,  has  suspended  the  work  as  it  is  mired  in the  scam.  #
 *  The  company  is  most  likely  to  incur  the  wrath  of the  State  government.  #
 *  The  KRDCL  has  sought  the  governments  permission  to  impose  a  penalty  of  Rs  1.19  lakh  per  day  affecting the  company  for  breaching  the  contract  agreement:  the  fund-starved  company  has  suspended  the  project  work  and a  last  three  months  and  allegedly  breached  the  contract  agreement  on  achieving  half-yearly  targets  set  for  project  implementation.  #
 *  The  company  had  started  implementing  the  Rs  246-crore  project  on  January  5,  2012.  #
 *  The  work  went  on  smoothly  till  July  last,  when  the  allegation  of the  companys  involvement  in the  coal  scam  cropped  up.  #
 *  The  CBI,  which  is  investigating  the  scam,  has  chargesheeted  the  owner  of  Abhijeet  Group,  Manoj  Jaiswal,  for  alleged irregularities in the  getting  coal block  allocation.  #
 *  The CBI  is  also  learnt  to  have  frozen  the  accounts  of the  company  and  hence,  it  has  not  been  able  to  mobilise  resources  to  implement  the  project,  officials  said.  #
 *  The  KRDCL  has  fixed  half-yearly  targets  for the  company  for  implementing  the  project.  #
 *  Accordingly,  it  should  complete  15.45  km  of  work  in  180  days,  38.50  km  in  365  days,  57.72  km  in  540  days  and  76.96  km  in  720  days.  #
 *  However,  the  company  has  so  far  completed  only  2.28  km.  #
 *  Actually,  it  should  have  completed  nearly  50  per cent  of the  work  as  per  the  agreement,  KRDCL  Deputy  Divisional  Engineer,  Hassan,  Veerabhadraswamy  told  Deccan  Herald.  #
 *  The  KDRCL,  Veerabhadraswamy  said,  has  issued  about  four  notices  for a  delay  in  implementation  of the  work.  #
 *  And  Consulting  Engineers  Service  Ltd,  the  third  party  agency  to  monitor  the  project,  has  issued  nearly  a  dozen  notices.  #
 *  The company, in its  reply,  has been  assuring  the  government  that  it  will  restart  the  work  shortly.  #
 *  The  consulting  company  recently  recommended  that some  project  promoter  could  be  fined  with  effect  from  October  2012,  as  there  was  a  provision  for  cure  period  of  about  90  days  and the  project  delay.  #
 *  However,  the  promoter  has  completed  earth  work  on  about  35  km  and  made  preparations  for  laying  concrete  pavement  on  about  16  km,  spending  close  to  Rs  60  crore,  officials  said.  #
 *  As  per  the  agreement,  the  company  has been  given  two  years  for  road  development  and  28  years  for  toll  collection.  #
 *  If  completed,  it  will  be  the  first  stretch  of  State  highway  to  become  a  concrete  road.  #
 *  Besides,  the  promoter  has  to  widen  the  existing  5.5-metre  road  to  9  metres  and  construct  cross-bridges  wherever  necessary  affecting the  route.  #
 *  The  KRDCL  had  recently  implemented  a  similar  road  development  project  on  Waghdari-Ribbonpally  State  highway.  #
 *  When  contacted,  KRDCL  Managing  Director  R  Srinivas  refused  to  comment.  #
 *  The  Central Bureau of Investigation  (CBI)  is expected to  register  cases  against  half  a  dozen  companies  over  next  48  hours  for  adopting  fraudulent  means  to  procure  coal  blocks.  #
 *  A  senior  agency  official  said  separate  cases  will  be  registered  against  the  companies.  #
 *  CBIs  decision  to  register  cases  for  alleged irregularities in the  coal block allocation  has  come  10  days  after  the  Comptroller and Auditor General  (CAG)  report  tabled  in  Parliament  on  August  17,  put  the  presumptive  loss  to the  exchequer  at  Rs  1.86  lakh  crore  due  to  arbitrary  allocation of coal  blocks.  #
 *  The  countrys  premiere  investigating  agency  registered  a  preliminary enquiry  (PE)  in  June  this  year  after  the  Central  Vigilance  Commission  forwarded  a  complaint  by  BJP  leaders  Prakash  Javadekar  and  Hansraj  Ahir  that  first-come-first-serve  basis  was  adopted  by the  government  to  benefit  some  private  companies.  #
 *  After  the  PE  or  initial  probe,  the  agency  registers  regular  case  (RC)  if  it  finds  sufficient  material  to  prove  prima facie  that  there  has been  commission  of  a  cognizable  offence.  #
 *  The CBI  is  all  set  to  register  regular  cases  against  nearly  six  companies  armed  with  strong  evidence  of  cheating and  forgery  while  applying  for  coal  blocks.  #
 *  The CBI  is  scanning  1,422  applications  received  by the  coal  ministry  from  146  private  companies  for a  allocation of  64  coal blocks  between 2006 and  2009.  #
 *  Agency  sources  said  the CBI  will  submit  a  report  to  CVC  in the  first  week  of  September.  #
 *  The  raging  controversy  over  coal block  allocation,  which  is  rocking  Parliament,  had  its  echo  in the  Odisha  Assembly  on  Tuesday  with  the  principal  Opposition  Congress  moving  an  adjournment  motion  on the  issue,  reports  DHNS?from?Bhubaneswar.  #
 *  Though  Speaker  Pradip  Amat  accepted  the  motion,  a  debate  was  not  possible  as a  Opposition  and  treasury  bench  members  got  into  a  verbal  duel  over  corruption  charges  against  senior  Congress MP  and  former  state  chief  minister  Hemananda  Biswal.  #
 *  The  Speaker  adjourned  the  house  for the  day  in the  afternoon  following  repeated  disruptions.  #
 *  "It is  not  yet  known  if  the  adjournment  motion  would  be  taken  up  on  Wednesday.  #
 *  The  Opposition,  particularly  Congress,  has been  demanding  the  resignation  of  Chief  Minister  Naveen  Patnaik  after  it  became  public  that the  Patnaik  himself  had  written  to the  Centre  recommending  coal block allocation  in favour of  a  private  firm.  #
 *  Both  houses  of  parliament  were  disrupted  Tuesday  over  the  Comptroller and Auditor General  (CAG)  reportedly  pointing  to  a  loss  of  over  Rs.180,000  crore  ($40  billion)  in the  allotment  of  coal  blocks.  #
 *  While  the  Rajya Sabha  was  adjourned  twice,  first  for  15  minutes  and  then  till  noon,  the  Lok Sabha  was  straightaway  adjourned  till  noon.  #
 *  Soon  after  the  Rajya Sabha  met  affecting the  last  day  of the  budget  session,  members  from  the  opposition  benches  raised  the  reported  loss  to  exchequer  in  allotment  of  coal  mines.  #
 *  Some  members  also  raised  the  issue  of  a  train  accident  in  Andhra  Pradesh.  #
 *  Opposition  members,  particularly  from  the  Left  parties,  raised  slogans  and  waved  a  newspaper  copy  carrying  the  CAG  report  on the  allocation of coal blocks  between  2004  and  2009  without  auction,  which  the  auditor  said  resulted  in  undue  benefits  of  Rs.180,000  crore  to  private  parties.  #
 *  Some  other  opposition  members  pointed  to the  train  accident  involving  the  Hampi  Express  for the  stationary  goods  train  in  Anantapur  district  in the  early  hours  of  Tuesday  in  which  15  people  were  killed.  #
 *  The  agitated  opposition  members  trooped  towards  Speaker  Meira  Kumar's  chair  and  continued  with  their  slogan  shouting.  #
 *  As  her  plea  to  let  the  question  hour  continue  went  unheeded,  Meira  Kumar  adjourned  the  house  till  noon.  #
 *  In  the  upper  house,  as  soon  as  it  met  for a  day,  BJP  member  Rajiv  Pratap  Rudy  urged  Chairman  Hamid  Ansari  to  suspend  the  question  hour  to  discuss  the  CAG  report.  #
 *  Ansari,  however,  ruled  this  out,  saying:  #
 *  "You  cannot  raise  questions  that  are  not  listed."  #
 *  Rudy  was  joined  by  other  BJP  members,  including  Prakash  Javadekar,  who  flashed,  what  he  claimed,  a  letter  from  the  Central  Vigilance  Commissioner  recommending  a  Central Bureau of Investigation  probe  in the  coal block  allocation.  #
 *  As  the  din  continued,  the  chair  ruled  that  "nothing  will  go  on  record".  #
 *  Defending  the  government,  Minister of state for  Parliamentary  Affairs  Rajiv  Shukla  said  the  CAG  report  has  not  yet  been  tabled.  #
 *  "Where  is  the  report?  #
 *  Report  has  not  been  tabled,"  he  said.  #
 *  As  the  opposition  members  continued  with  their  protests,  the  upper  house  was  first  adjourned  for  15  minutes  and  then  till  12  noon.  #
 *  Both  houses  resumed  their  functioning  at  12  noon.  #
 *  The  coalgate  resurfaced  on  Saturday  to  haunt  the  United  Progressive  Alliance  (UPA)  government,  with  the  Bharatiya  Janata  Party  charging  the  government  with  vetting  a  CBI  probe  report  affecting the  scam  in  an  attempt  to  save  Prime Minister Manmohan  Singh.  #
 *  The  BJP  also  demanded  that  a  special  investigation  team  (SIT)  should  be  constituted  to  probe  the  scam  as  the CBI  has been  compromised  and  also  that  Union  Law Minister Ashwani Kumar  who  had  seen  the  report  be  dropped.  #
 *  The  Congress,  however,  denied  the  charges.  #
 *  Leader  of  Opposition  in the  Lok Sabha  Sushma  Swaraj  tweeted  that the  government  vetted  the  coal  scam  report  that  the CBI  will  present  before  the  Supreme  Court.  #
 *  She  was  reacting  to  a  news  report  published  on  Saturday.  #
 *  This is  very  serious  matter.  #
 *  This is  the  evidence  of  governments  pressure  on  the CBI  to  save  the  prime  minister,  she  charged  in  her  post.  #
 *  The  PMO  and  Law Minister Ashwani Kumar  had  reportedly  accessed  the  status report  and  sought  changes  in  it  before  handing  it  over  to the  Supreme  Court,  media  reports  had  revealed.  #
 *  Dubbing  UPA  a  rogue  government  that  is  interfering  in the  administration  of  justice,  Leader  of  Opposition  in the  Lok Sabha  Arun  Jaitley  said  the  UPA  would  not  allow  the CBI  to  function  independently.  #
 *  The CBI  cannot  find  out  the  truth  and  even  if  some  honest  officer  in the  CBI  tries  to  find  out  the  truth,  the  UPA  is  a  rogue  government  which  will  not  allow  it  to  operate  independently,  Jaitley  alleged.  #
 *  Persons  named  in the  report  should  publicly  speak  whether  this  is  true  or  otherwise.  #
 *  The  original  unaltered  report  of the  CBI  must  be  made  public  and  also  placed  before  the  Supreme  Court,  he  said.  #
 *  In  a meeting with  CBI  director  Ranjit  Sinha  some  time  back,  Law Minister Ashwani Kumar  is  reported  to  have  asked  the  agency  to  tweak  the  status report  that  was  to be  filed  before  the  this court  hearing  the  coal  scam  petition.  #
 *  Last  month  the  bench  asked  the  agency  to  file  in  writing  if  the  status report  had  not  been  vetted  by the  political  executive.  #
 *  The  Supreme Court  is  asking  the CBI  to  submit  its  report  and  government  is  toning  it  down.  #
 *  This is  and the  first  time  to  my  knowledge  that  such  a  thing  is  happening,  an  aghast  Janata  Dal-United  spokesperson  Shivanand  Tiwari  said  when  his  reaction  was  sought.  #
 *  CPM  leader  Sitaram  Yechury  also  did  not  spare  the  UPA  government  and  announced  that  matter  would  be  raised  in the  coming  session  of the  Parliament  starting  from  April  22.  #
 *  Coal  Minister  Sriprakash  Jaiswal,  who  was  at  the  centre  of  controversy  in the  UPA-2  government,  was  non-committal.  #
 *  The  Congress  was  not  perturbed  by the  controversy.  There is  no  question  of  resignation  of  Law Minister  Ashwani  Kumar.  #
 *  The  Supreme Court  has  already  asked  the CBI  to  file  an  affidavit  in  this  regard.  #
 *  The CBI  will  file  its  affidavit  and  truth  will  come  out,  party  spokesperson  Rashid  Alvi  said.  #
 *  The  Comptroller and Auditor General  had  submitted  a  report  to  Parliament  last  year  exposing  a  loss  of  Rs  1.86  lakh  crore  in the  allocation of coal blocks  since  2004.  #
 *  The  report  had  cast  aspersion  on the  role  of  Manmohan  Singh  as  he  was  the  coal  minister  when  the  scam  was  brewing.  #
 *  Competition  Commission  of  India  (CCI)  member  and  former coal secretary  H  C  Gupta,  who  is  set  to be  questioned  by the  CBI  in connection with  coal-gate  scam,  has  submitted  his  resignation  to the  government.  #
 *  The  resignation  came  soon  after  the  Corporate  Affairs  Ministry  gave  a  green  signal  to the  CBI  to  question  Gupta,  with  regard  to the  coal blocks allocation  scam.  #
 *  Gupta  was  the  Coal Secretary  between 2006 and  2009,  the  period  which  is  under  the  scanner  for  the CBI  for  alleged irregularities in the  utilisation of coal  blocks.  #
 *  Soon  after  his  retirement  as  coal  secretary,  the  government  appointed  him  a  member  of  fair  trade  regulator  CCI.  #
 *  His  tenure  was  to  end  to  early  next  year.  #
 *  The  BJP  on  Friday  attempted  to  revive  the  Coalgate  topic,  alleging  there  was  a  huge  scam  in the  cancellation  of  block  allotments  that  are  still  to be  mined  well  past  the  deadline.  #
 *  The  BJP  held  the  coal  minister  and  Inter-Ministerial  Group  (IMG)  responsible  for  undue  delay  in  taking  decisions  against  cancellation.  #
 *  Party  MP  Hansraj  Ahir,  who,  along  with  colleague  Prakash  Javadekar,  is  credited  with  exposing  the  scam,  told reporters  that  there  was  a  huge  scam  in the  cancellation  of the  blocks  as  well,  like  in  their  allocations.  #
 *  The  coal  ministry  for a  government  had  given  three  years  and  six  months  or  four  years  and  six  months  (in  case  of  forest  area  mines)  to  companies  for  development  and  mining  of  coal  from  open  cast  and  underground  mines.  #
 *  Our  charge  is  that  though  most  of the  companies  have  not  developed  the  mines  nor  started  mining,  their  allotment  has  not  been  cancelled,  Ahir  said.  #
 *  The  rules  point  out  that  a  bank  guarantee  of  one  years  royalty  should  be  taken  from  a  company  that  wins  allotment.  #
 *  If  the  company  fails  to  mine  in  stipulated  time,  the  ministry  has  the  right  to  encash  50  per cent  of the  royalty.  #
 *  However,  no  action  has been  taken  by the  government,  the  MP  said.  #
 *  Along  with  Jaiswal,  the  coal  controller,  the  coal  secretary  and  IMG  members  are  also  involved  in  this.  #
 *  They  are  all  committing  financial  wrongdoings  and  playing  a  fraud  affecting the  country.  #
 *  There  has been  extortion  also,  Ahir  charged.  #
 *  The  BJPs  move  to  file  a  complaint  at  different  police  stations  in  several  states  against  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  in the  coalgate  scam  has  made  the  UPA  government  jittery,  with  legal  opinions  being  sought  on  implications  of the  move.  #
 *  "It is  learnt  that some  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  had  sought  legal  opinion  from  Union  Law  Ministry,  which  said  that certain  prime  minister  does  not  enjoy  immunity  from  FIR  being  lodged  against  him.  #
 *  In  a  big  embarrassment  to the  government  in the  Coalgate  case,  the  Supreme Court  today  termed  as  "very  disturbing"  the CBI  affidavit  on  sharing  its  report  with  the  Law Minister  and  others  and  slammed  the  agency  for  having  kept  the  court  in the  dark  affecting the  issue.  #
 *  Hearing  the  coal blocks allocation scam case in  a  packed  courtroom,  the  bench  said  "suppression"  of the  fact  that  CBI  has  shared  its  probe  report  with  the  government  is  "not  ordinary".  #
 *  A  bench headed by  Justice  R  M  Lodha  observed  that  there  was  a  "very  disturbing  feature"  in the  affidavit  filed  on  April  26  by  CBI Director Ranjit Sinha  and the  agency  must  be  restored  to  its  independent  position.  #
 *  Sinha,  in  his  two  page  affidavit  filed  in the  apex  court,  had  said  that certain  agency's  status report  on  coal blocks allocation  scam  was  "shared"  with  Law Minister Ashwani Kumar  and  senior  officials  of  PMO  and  Coal  ministry  "as desired by  them".  #
 *  The  apex court  said  that  sharing  of  information  with  the  government  about  the  probe into the  scam  has  "shaken  the  entire  process"  and  CBI  need  not  take  instructions  from  "political  masters"  on  their  probe.  #
 *  "Our  first  exercise  will  be  to  liberate  CBI  from  political  interference,"  the  bench  said.  #
 *  In  his  affidavit,  the CBI  Director  had  said,  "I  submit  that some  draft  of the  same  (status  report)  was  shared  with  Law Minister  "as desired by  him  prior  to  its  submission  before  the  Supreme  Court.  #
 *  Besides  the  political  executive,  it  was  also  shared  with  one  joint  secretary  level  officer  each  of  Prime Minister's  Office  and  Ministry  of  Coal  as desired by  them."  #
 *  The CBI  Director  had  also  assured  the  apex court  that certain  agency  will  not  share  further  status  reports  in  this  case  with  any  member  of the  political  executive.  #
 *  Sinha's  affidavit  had  contradicted  the  claim  made  by  Additional  Solicitor  General  Haren  Raval  on  behalf  of  CBI  on  March  12  that the  probe  report  in the  scam  has  not  been  shared  with  any  member  of the  government  and  it  has  only  been  shared  with  the  this court  after  being  vetted  by the  CBI  director.  #
 *  The  affidavit  was  filed  in  compliance  with  the  Supreme  Court's  order  which,  in  an  unprecedented  move  on  March  12,  had  directed  the CBI  director  to  assure  the  court  that some  status report  in the  coalgate  scam  is  not  being  shared  with  the  government.  #
 *  Today's  hearing  came  a  day  after  Raval  shot  off  a  letter  to  Attorney  General  G E  Vahanvati  in  which  he  alleged  that  he  has been  made  a  "scapegoat"  in the  matter.  #
 *  Raval  is  also  believed  to  have  accused  Vahanvati  of  trying  to  interfere  in  CBI's  probe  report.  #
 *  Earlier,  the CBI  and the  Centre  had  clashed  over  the  coalgate  scam.  #
 *  The  agency  had  told  the  court  that  there  have been  "arbitrary  allotments  without  scrutiny"  in the  coal blocks allocation  during  the  UPA-I  tenure.  #
 *  The  government  had  refuted  its  findings  saying  that certain  "CBI  is  not  the  final  word  on  this."  #
 *  In  the  status report  filed  by  CBI  on  March  8,  the  agency  had  said  that certain  coal block allocation  during  2006-09  was  done  without  verifying  the  credentials  of  companies  which  allegedly  misrepresented  facts  about  themselves  and  no  rationale  was  given  by the  Coal Ministry  in  giving  coal blocks  to  them.  #
 *  Team  Anna  on  Friday  disapproved  of  entrusting  the  investigation  of  irregularities  in the  coal block allocation  to the  Central Bureau of Investigation  (CBI).  #
 *  We  have  no  faith  in  CBI  investigating  Coalgate  scam  because  the CBI  directly  reports  to  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  and  is  directly  controlled  by  him.  #
 *  The  outcome  of  such  an  investigation  is  already  known  the  prime  minister  will  be  given  a  clean  chit  in the  end,  Arvind  Kejriwal  told  media-persons.  #
 *  If  the  prime  minister  is  really  honest  why  is  he  scared  of  independent  investigation?  #
 *  Why  does  he  want  himself  to be  investigated  by  an  agency  directly  controlled  by  him?  asked  Kejriwal.  #
 *  Let  the  charges  against  all  the  15  ministers  be  investigated  by  this  special  investigation  team  (SIT),  he  demanded.  #
 *  Kejriwal  also  attacked  Law Minister  Salman  Khurshid  for  refusing  an  investigation  into  the  scam  and  said,  Khurshid  himself  is  one  of  those  15  ministers  who  have been  accused  of  corruption.  #
 *  He  accused  the  government  of  using  the CBI  to  pursue  its  political  agenda,  #
 *  Disproportionate  asset  cases  are  going  on  against  Mulayam  Singh  Yadav,  Lalu  Prasad  Yadav,  Mayawati  and  many  other  politicians  for  several  years.  #
 *  However  no  worthwhile  investigation  has  taken  place.  #
 *  But  Jaganmohan  Reddy,  who  is  a  political  foe  of the  ruling  UPA  has been  arrested  in  a  very  short  period.  #
 *  We  need  a  SIT,  which  is  completely  independent  of the  government,  to  investigate  allegations  against  the  15  corrupt  ministers  said  the  Team  Anna  member.  #
 *  He  rejected  coal  ministrys  rebuttal  and  said,  However,  CAG  has  estimated  this  loss  at  Rs  1.8  lakh  crore.  #
 *  Who  took  this  decision  to  forego  this  revenue?  #
 *  Coal Secretary  kept  on  opposing  utilisation of coal blocks  through  the  Screening Committee  method  alleged  the  anti-graft  activist.  #
 *  The  CBI?on  Friday  ruled  out  scrutinising  the  role  of  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  in the  coal blocks  controversy.  #
 *  However,  the  agency  registered  a  preliminary enquiry  (PE)  into  the  alleged irregularities in the  utilisation of coal blocks  to  private  companies  between 2006 and  2009.  #
 *  The CBI  has  registered  a  PE  in  this  issue.  #
 *  The  agency  will  inquire  into  the  allegations  of  irregularities  in the  utilisation of coal  blocks,  a  senior  official  of the  central  probe  agency  told  Deccan  Herald.  #
 *  The  agency,  however,  clarified  that  it  will  not  look  into  the  policy  matters  related  to the  allocation of coal blocks  as the  officer  asserted  that  probe  would  primarily  focus  on the  alleged irregularities in the  utilisation of coal blocks  by the  allottee  companies.  #
 *  The CBI  registers  a  PE  to  start  initial  probe  before  registering  a  regular  case  (RC).  #
 *  A  preliminary enquiries  is  converted  into  RC  if  agency  gets  sufficient  material  to  show  that  prima facie  there  has been  commission  of  a  cognisable  offence.  #
 *  Countrys  premier  investigating  agency  registered  the  PE  a  day  after  the  Central  Vigilance  Commission  forwarded  to the  CBI  a  complaint  of  BJP  leaders  Prakash  Javadekar  and  Hansraj  Ahir  in  which  they  had  alleged  that  first-come-first-serve  basis  was  adopted  by the  government  to  benefit  some  private  companies.  #
 *  "We  are  happy  that some  CVC  took  cognisance  of  our  complaint,  Javadekar  said,  while  responding  to the  developments  in the  matter.  #
 *  In  their  complaint,  the  BJP  leaders  had  said  that the  prime  minister  was  in  charge  of the  Coal Ministry  when  most  allocations  were  made.  #
 *  The  complaint  also  alleged  that  there  was  a  delay  of  nearly  two  years  in  auctioning  process  claiming  that some  ministry  had  done  so  to  benefit  some  private  players.  #
 *  The  complaint  also  alleged  that some  allottee  companies  did  not  start  production  themselves,  but  outsourced  the  operation  to  third  parties  at  a  premium  and  pocketed  the  benefit.  #
 *  In  his  complaint,  Ahir  had  alleged  that  1,700  crore  metric  tonne  of  coal  worth  Rs  51  lakh  crore  was  given  almost  free  to  private  companies.  #
 *  Ahir  wrote  first  to  CAG  in  2010  demanding  that  it  should  conduct  a  "special  audit"  of the  coal  mining  cases.  #
 *  "We  wrote  again  in  March  this  year  and the  CVC  replied  to  us  on  May  17,  2012.  #
 *  We  will  now  wait  for  the CBI  to  come  out  with  its  inquiry  report,"  Javadekar  said.  #
 *  Meanwhile,  the  prime  minister  is  understood  to  have  briefed  the  Congress  Core  Group  comprising  party  chief  Sonia  Gandhi  and  other  senior  leaders  on  the CBI  beginning  a  PE  in the  matter.  #
 *  Union  Coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal  has  refuted  the  allegation  of  scam  and  defended  the  mechanism  adopted  by the  government  in  allotting  coal  mining  blocks.  #
 *  "There  is  no  scam  in the  allocation of coal  blocks.  #
 *  The  same  principles  are  being  followed  in  allotting  coal blocks  during  the  last  15  years  for  providing  subsidised  power  to the  people,"  Jaiswal  told reporters  here.  #
 *  Business  tycoon  Kumar Mangalam Birla  on  Friday  said  he  wasn't  worried  about  the  case  that some  Central Bureau of Investigation  (CBI)  filed  against  him  in connection with  alleged irregularities in the  allocation of coal blocks  to  one  his  group  companies.  #
 *  "I  am  not  worried  about  the  FIR...  life  goes  on.  #
 *  I  won't  like  to  comment.  #
 *  There  are  many  more  things  to  do,"  television  news  channels  quoted  Birla  as  saying  after  a meeting with  finance  minister  P  Chidambaram.  #
 *  The  case  filed  by  CBI  has  triggered  a  major  uproar  in the  political  landscape,  with  the  opposition  intensifying  its  attack  on the  government  and  the Prime Minister, who  held  charge  of the  coal  ministry  during  this  period.  #
 *  Birla  didn't  give  details  of  his  meeting  with  the  finance  minister,  saying  they  "discussed  various  things."  #
 *  India  Inc  has  hit  out  at  the CBI  for  registering  a  case  against  Birla  in the  coal  scam,  saying  such  action  would  dampen  business  sentiment  and  affect  growth.  #
 *  The  Federation  of  Indian  Chambers  of  Commerce  and  Industry  (FICCI)  have  said  such  incidents  were  unfortunate  and  it  would  dent  the  national  psyche  and  also  dampen  investor  confidence.  #
 *  The  Bharatiya  Janata  Party  (BJP)  would  hold  nationwide  protests  May  4-5  against  the  United  Progressive  Alliance  (UPA)  government  over  irregularities  in  coal blocks  and  2G  spectrum  allocations,  the  party  announced  on  Sunday.  #
 *  "BJP  has  decided  to  take  the  fight  against  corruption  from  parliament  to the  people  of the  country.  #
 *  The  party  will  organise  massive  protests  and  dharnas  in  all  state  capitals  on  May  4  and  5,"  BJP  spokesperson  Prakash  Javadekar  told reporters  in  New  Delhi.  #
 *  He  said  the  party  would  continue  to  raise  the  issues  in  parliament  as  well.  #
 *  "We  will  continue  to  fight  against  massive  corruption  of the  Congress  regime  and  its  shameless  cover-up,"  he  said.  #
 *  The  BJP  has been  demanding  law  minister  Ashwani  Kumar's  resignation  for  vetting  a  CBI  affidavit  affecting the  coal blocks allocation  which  was  meant  only  and the  Supreme  Court.  #
 *  The  demand  has been  rejected  by the  government.  #
 *  The  opposition  party  also  sought  Prime Minister Manmohan  Singh's  resignation  after  former  telecom  minister  A  Raja  alleged  that certain  prime  minister  was  in the  loop  while  decisions  were  taken  regarding  allocation  of the  2G  spectrum.  #
 *  With  all  eyes  fixed  affecting the  crucial  hearing  in the  coal blocks allocation  case  in the  Supreme Court  on  Tuesday,  the  government  appears  to be  bracing  itself  for the  virtual  repeat  scenario  which  it  faced  in the  2G  telecom  and  black  money  cases  in the  top  court.  #
 *  Faced  with  twin  problems  of  breaking  the  logjam  in  parliament,  the  government  is  left  with  little  option  other  than  to  agree  either  for the  court-monitored  investigation  or  setting  up  of  an  independent  Special  Investigation  Team.  #
 *  Government  sources  have  indicated  the  governments  readiness  to  agree  for a  Supreme  Court-monitored  CBI  probe.  #
 *  In  the  2G  case,  the  CBIs  response  had  infuriated  the  Supreme Court  as the  investigating  agency  wanted  six  months  to  complete  the  probe.  #
 *  The  court  was  furious  at  no  action  having  been  taken  for the  year,  despite  the  FIR  having  been  lodged  in  October  2009.  #
 *  Infact,  a  terse  comment  by the  bench  of  Justices  GS  Singhvi  and  AK  Ganguly  about  the  slipshod  probe into the  case,  which  spurred  both  the CBI  and the  government  into  action,  leading  to  a  spate  of  arrests  within  a  fortnight.  #
 *  This  was  followed  by the  Supreme Court  taking  a  similar  tough  stand  in the  black  money  case.  #
 *  In  July  2011,  dissatisfied  with  the  lack  of  seriousness  shown  by the  government  in  bringing  back  huge  amounts  of  black  money  stashed  abroad,  the  top  court  had  set  up  a  SIT.  #
 *  The  court  had  appointed  former  Supreme Court  judge  Justice  BP  Jeevan  Reddy  and  had  directed  the  government  to  ask  the  members  of  its  high  level  committee  to  report  to  Justice  Reddy.  #
 *  The  government  was  not  happy  with  the  judgment,  and  its  review  petition  is  still  pending  in the  Supreme  Court.  #
 *  Another  example  of the  Supreme Court  forming  a  SIT  was  in the  Gujarat  riots  cases,  where  10  major  cases  were  handed  over  it  following  allegations  of  state  police  being  biased.  #
 *  A  day  after  law  minister  Ashwani  Kumar  briefed  his  party  and  ministry  colleagues  affecting the  "sharing  of  CBI's  status  report"  on the  coal blocks allocation  scam,  the  Congress  and the  government  on  Thursday  rallied  behind  him.  #
 *  The  first  to  come  out  in  his  defence  was  external  affairs  minister  Salman  Khurshid,  who  argued  that  the CBI  under  the  present  arrangement  cannot  work  in  isolation.  #
 *  "The  law  ministry  provides  all  logistic  support,  including  counsels,  to the  CBI.  #
 *  But  this  (sharing  of  report)  is  not  as  if  the  law  ministry  has  interfered  in  investigations,"  he  said.  #
 *  A  senior  CBI  official  concurred  with  Khurshid's  views.  #
 *  "Unlike  the  election  commission  for the  CAG,  the CBI  is  not  a  statutory  body  and  is  part  of the  executive  government.  #
 *  So,  it  is  unrealistic  to  expect  that  the CBI  will  act  in  isolation,"  he  said.  #
 *  Earlier  on  Friday  morning,  Parliamentary  affairs  minister  Kamal  Nath,  Congress  president  Sonia  Gandhi's  political  secretary  Ahmed  Patel  for a  law  minister  held  an  hour-long  meeting  with  Prime Minister Manmohan  Singh.  #
 *  Briefing  government  and  party  spokespersons  on the  entire  matter  on  Wednesday,  Kumar  had  stressed  that  there  was  nothing  wrong  in  his  meeting  the CBI  director  as  it  was  well  under  his  jurisdiction.  #
 *  He  further  stated  that some  law  minister  is  the  legal  advisor  for  the CBI  under  the  existing  laws.  #
 *  The  Congress  also  backed  him.  #
 *  "The  law  minister  has  repeatedly  maintained  that  he  has  done  no  wrong.  #
 *  We  have  no  reason  to  disbelieve  him.  #
 *  He  is  an  eminent  lawyer  for the  man  of  great  standing  and  great  integrity  What  he  has  stated  is  fairly  acceptable,"  party  spokesman  Sandeep  Dikshit  said.  #
 *  There  could  not  have been  a  worse  turn  of  events  for a  government  already  on the  ropes.  #
 *  The  Supreme  Courts  damning  indictment  of the  UPA  governments  conduct  in the  CBIs  probe into the  coal  scam  has  raised  many  issues  which  will  cause,  and  rightly  so,  acute  embarrassment  to  it.  #
 *  It  now  transpires  that certain  law  minister,  officials  from  the  coal  ministry  and  even  some  from  the  PMO  had  sought  and  made  changes  in the  report  that  the CBI  had  framed.  #
 *  The  court  has  raised  a  number  of  vexing  questions.  #
 *  Did  the  law  minister  have  the  authority  to  ask  for the  report?  #
 *  What  were  the  changes  that  were  made  in  it?  #
 *  And  most  importantly,  why  was  there  an  attempt  to  cover  these  actions  up?  #
 *  Any  way  one  looks  at  it,  the  government  has  not  covered  itself  in  glory.  #
 *  The  court  now  rightly  wants  to  know  how  many  people  were  privy  to the  report  on  this  sensitive  and  politically  explosive  issue.  #
 *  By  May  6,  the CBI  will  have  to  provide  information  about  all  the  changes  that  have been  made  to the  original  report.  #
 *  It is  either  extreme  political  naivet  or  a  reckless  disregard  for the  consequences  that  led  to the  law  minister  and  others  to  ask  to  not  only  see  but  allegedly  make  changes  to  a  report  which  is  supposed  to be  framed  in  a  completely  independent  manner.  #
 *  Given  that  it  has been  beset  by  one  scam  after  another,  the  UPA  government  should  have  conducted  itself  with  utmost  probity  and  caution  on  this  issue.  #
 *  The  law  minister  could  not  have been  unaware  of the  impropriety  of  asking  and the  CBI  report  into  a  scam  in  which  his  own  government  is  allegedly  involved.  #
 *  Yet,  he  went  ahead  with  this,  leading  to the  court  now  telling  the CBI  that  it  does  not  need  to  take  instructions  from  its  political  masters.  #
 *  Whether  the  law  minister  now  goes  or  stays,  the  damage  has been  done.  #
 *  The  public  and  Parliament  have  the  right  to  know  what  exactly  transpired  and  what  are  the  possible  effects  of the  changes  that  were  made.  #
 *  The  court  has been  unequivocal  in  stating  that  this  has  shaken  the  very  foundations  of the  system.  #
 *  And  once  again,  the  court  has  reiterated  what  has been  a  longstanding  demand  from  many  quarters  that  of  autonomy  and a  CBI.  #
 *  At  face  value,  the  law  ministers  actions  suggest  that certain  government  has  something  to  hide  and  that  he  was  trying  to  contain  the  damage.  #
 *  Thanks  to  this  ineptitude,  Parliament  does  not  seem  able  to  conduct  any  other  business.  #
 *  The  UPA  cannot  be  unaware  that  its  second  tenure  has  seen  more  Parliament  time  wasted  than  any  other.  #
 *  Yet,  it  is  literally  handing  the  Opposition  issue  after  issue  with  which  to  put  it  affecting the  mat.  #
 *  The  government,  it  would  seem,  is  its  own  worst  enemy  at  the  moment.  #
 *  CPI(M)  on  Friday  attacked  Commerce  Minister  Anand  Sharma  for  his  statements  on  CBI  naming  a  leading  industrialist  in the  coal  scam,  saying  it  was  a  "blatant"  attempt  to  influence  the  case.  #
 *  It is  shocking  that  a  Union  Minister,  Anand  Sharma,  has  come  out  in  defence  of  a  big  industrialist  claiming  he  is  innocent  in the  case.  #
 *  This is  nothing  but  a  blatant  effort  to  influence  the  case  and  intimidate  the  CBI,"  the  party  Politburo  said  in  a  statement  here.  #
 *  It  said  Sharma's  stand  was  "also  to  justify  the  covert  policy  of  privatising  the  coal  industry  which  is  the  root  cause  for the  corruption  involved".  #
 *  Demanding  that  CBI  should  "proceed  in the  entire  investigation  and  pursue  the  guilty  without  fear  or  favour",  CPI(M)  also  sought  "a  thorough  investigation  in  this  case  of  allocating  natural  resources  illegally  to  ensure  windfall  profits  to  certain  companies".  #
 *  "Since  this  involved  the  period  when  the  Prime Minister  was  incharge  of the  Ministry  of  Coal,  this  aspect  also  needs  investigation,"  the  party  said.  #
 *  CBI  has  lodged  an  FIR  against  industrialist  and  Chairman  of  Hindalco,  Kumar Mangalam Birla,  and the  former  Coal Secretary  as  part  of  its  ongoing  probe  in the  coal blocks allocation  case.  #
 *  BJP  on  Thursday  alleged  that  the scope of the coal scam  goes  all  the  way  to  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  since  he  was  the  final  signatory  for  all  the  allocations  and  sought  to  know  how  Coal Secretary  P  C  Parakh  is  being  held  responsible  but  not  the  minister  who  held  the  portfolio.  #
 *  "The  trail  of the  coal blocks allocation  scam  goes  all  the  way  to  7,  Race  Course  Road  (PM's  residence).  #
 *  If  in the  Commonwealth  Games  scam  the  person  who  put  the  final  signature  was  held  accountable  and  jailed,  then  what  is  the  reason  that  the Prime Minister, who  held  the  coal  portfolio,  is  not  responsible,"  BJP  spokesperson  Shahnawaz  Hussain  said.  #
 *  He  asked  if  Parakh  is  being  accused  of  wrongdoing  because  he  was  the  Coal  Secretary,  then  why  is  the  Prime Minister  not  culpable?  #
 *  Citing  another  instance,  the  BJP  leader  said  in the  2G  spectrum  scam  A  Raja  was  made  an  accused  as  he  was  the  Telecom  Minister  then  why  is  the  then  coal  minister  and  Prime Minister  not  being  held  accountable  and the  coal  scam.  #
 *  The  main  Opposition  had  demanded  on  Wednesday  that certain  Prime Minister  should  tender  his  resignation  immediately.  #
 *  "BJP  wants  to  know  why  PM  is  not  being  held  accountable.  #
 *  We  will  take  this  issue  to the  people  most  of  whom  are  already  aware  of  it  by  now,"  Hussain  said.  #
 *  He  claimed  this  augurs  well  for a  party  as the  wave  is  being  built  in  its  favour  due  to  such  scams  and a  charisma  of  BJP's  prime  ministerial  candidate  Narendra  Modi.  #
 *  "The  kind  of  atmosphere  we  are  witnessing  today,  BJP  will  not  just  cross  272+  mark  (the  majority  in  Lok  Sabha)  but  get  many  more  seats.  #
 *  The  polls  have  not  yet  been  announced  for a  battlefield  has  not  yet  been  set  but  it  is  obvious  as  to  who  will  fly  the  victory  flag  in the  next  elections,"  Hussain  claimed.  #
 *  Making  a  stinging  criticism  of  CBI  and  senior  officials  of the  coal  ministry  and  PMO,  the  Supreme Court  today  hauled  them  up  for  changing  the  'heart'  of the  Coalgate  probe  report  but  appeared  to  have  given  a  breather  to the  Law Minister Ashwani Kumar  for a  government  and the  time  being.  #
 *  Observing  that  CBI  was  like  a  'caged  parrot,'  the  court  said  it  should  stand  up  to  all  'pulls  and  pressures'  and  not  share  its  probe  with  anyone  including  the  Law  Minister.  #
 *  In  a  significant  order  after  a  three-hour  hearing,  the  bench headed by  Justice  R  M  Lodha  asked  the  government  to  make  an  effort  to  come  out  with  a  law  before  July  10  to  insulate  CBI  from  external  influence  and  intrusion.  #
 *  It  also  directed  CBI  not  to  share  any  report  pertaining  to the  investigation  in the  coal blocks allocation  scam  with  any  officials  or  ministers  other  than  those  in  its  33-member  investigation  team  and  the CBI  Director.  #
 *  "The  heart  of the  report  was  changed  on  suggestions  of  government  officials,"  the  court  said  in  an  apparent  reference  to the  raging  controversy  over  the  sharing  of the  draft  status report  with  political  executive  and  joint  secretaries  in the  Coal  ministry  for a  PMO.  #
 *  The CBI  action  had  triggered  a  major  political  controversy  with  Opposition,  particularly  BJP,  demanding  the  sacking  of  Law Minister Ashwani Kumar  and  resignation  of  Prime Minister Manmohan  Singh.  #
 *  As  a  result,  the  'whole  direction'  of the  probe  was  changed,  the  court  said.  #
 *  The  court  directed  that  immediate  steps  be  taken  by  Centre  and  CBI  to  repatriate  DIG  Ravi  Kant  Mishra,  who  was  the  investigating  officer  in  coal blocks allocation  case  and  was  shifted  out  to  Intelligence  Bureau.  #
 *  The  Central Bureau of Investigation  (CBI)  on  Tuesday  filed  FIRs  against  industrialist  Kumar Mangalam Birla  and  former coal secretary  PC  Parekh  for  alleged  irregularities  and  criminal conspiracy  in  allocation of  two  coal blocks  in  Orissa  in  2005.  #
 *  Coordinated  searches  were  carried out  at  offices  of the  Aditya Birla  group  in  Mumbai,  New  Delhi, Hyderabad and  Bhubaneswar  on  Tuesday.  #
 *  The  FIRs  against  Kumar Mangalam Birla  the  chief  of the  Aditya Birla  group,  and  Parekh  are  under  the  Prevention of Corruption  Act.  #
 *  The  CAG,  whose  report  on the  utilisation of coal blocks  in  2012  led  to the  CBI  investigation,  had  named  Parekh  as a  whistleblower.  #
 *  The CBI  has  now  filed  14  FIRs  in the  case.  #
 *  "CBI  has  registered  a  fresh  case  in  alleged irregularities in the  coal  scam  against  the  then  coal  secretary,  Hindalco,  representative  of  Adita  Birla  Group,  unknown  persons  and  officials,"  CBIspokesperson  Kanchan  Prasad  said.  #
 *  A  Hindalco  spokesperson  said  the  company  had  not  received  a  copy  of the  FIR.  #
 *  The  spokesperson  denied  any  wrongdoing  by the  company.  #
 *  Hindalco  informed  the  Bombay  Stock  Exchange:  #
 *  "We wish to state unambiguously that we have followed every process required for allocation of coal completely, as stipulated by the  government  policy."  #
 *  The  company's  shares  closed  1.45  per cent  up  after  falling  initially.  #
 *  According  to the  CBI  FIR,  in  2005,  the  "said  persons  in  criminal conspiracy  with  one  another  (and  a  public  servant)  showed  undue  favour  to  an  Odisha-based  industry  in  allocation of  Talabira II  and  III  coal  blocks,  along  with  a  PSU  (Neyveli  Lignite  Corporation)  in  Tamil  Nadu".  #
 *  Kumar Mangalam Birla  is  the  second  major  industrialist  after  Naveen  Jindal,  chief  of the  JSPL  group,  to be  named  in the  coal  FIRs.  #
 *  The  UPA  government  could  be  in  for  some  major  embarrassment  in the  coal blocks  allotment  scandal  as  the CBI  is  learnt  to be  inclined  to  inform  the  Supreme Court  that some  controversial  probe  status report  it  submitted  last  month  had  been  vetted  by  Law Minister Ashwani Kumar  and  Prime Minister's  Office  officials.  #
 *  Sources  told  The  Indian  Express  that  senior  CBI  officials,  including  director  Ranjit  Sinha,  were  summoned  by  Kumar  days  before  the  status report  was  filed.  #
 *  During  the  lengthy  meeting,  also  attended  by  some  officials  of the  law  ministry,  several  amendments  in the  status report  were  suggested  and  some  also  incorporated  by the  CBI.  #
 *  "We  resisted  as  much  as  we  could,  but  yes,  some  toning  down  was  done  following  the  meeting,"  a  CBI  officer  present  at  the  meeting  in  Shastri  Bhavan  said.  #
 *  Sources  also  told  The  Indian  Express  that some  CBI's  status report  was  similarly  "vetted''  by  senior  PMO  officials.  #
 *  During  that  meeting,  a  team  of  CBI  officers,  which  did  not  include  Sinha,  was  present  although  it  is  not  clear  whether  more  changes  were  made  in the  report  at  this  meeting.  #
 *  The  CBI's  stand  in the  report,  submitted  to the  apex court  on  March  8,  differs  from  that  of the  government.  #
 *  The  report  pointed  out  irregularities  in  coal blocks  allotment  made  in  2006-09  during  UPA-1,  and  said  it  was  done  without  verifying  the  credentials  of  companies  which  allegedly  misrepresented  facts  about  themselves.  #
 *  The  government  had  refuted  the  CBI's  findings  in the  court  on  March  12,  with  Attorney  General  G E  Vahanvati  saying  the CBI  could  not  be  the  "final  word"  on  it.  #
 *  But  in  an  unprecedented  move,  the  Supreme Court  had  asked  Sinha  to  clarify  through  an  affidavit  if  the  status report  had  been  examined  by the  government  as  Vahanvati,  when  asked,  told  the  court  he  had  not  gone  through  the  report.  #
 *  Congress MP  Naveen  Jindal,  who  is likely to  be  quizzed  by  CBI  which  was  has  named  him  as  an investor in the  its  latest  FIR  in connection with  coal  scam,  is expected to  return  from  abroad  only  by  month  end.  #
 *  CBI sources said  they  had  asked  for  his  early  return  from  abroad  so  that some  agency  could  complete  its  search  at  his  residence  but  it  has been  communicated  to  them  that  Jindal  is believed to  return  in the  last  week  of the  month  and  only  then  he  would  be  available  for  questioning.  #
 *  During  searches,  CBI  was  unable  to  complete  its  operation  at  Jindal's  6-Prithviraj  Road  residence  here  as  some  of the  cupboards and almirahs  were  locked  and  it  was  told  that  they  could  only  be  unlocked  by  Jindal  who  was  abroad.  #
 *  CBI sources said  today  that the  search  team  had  no  option  but  to  seal  these  cupboards  and  wait  for the  return  of  Jindal.  #
 *  They said  Jindal  along  with  former  minister of State for  Coal  D  Narayan  Rao  were  booked  for  alleged  cheating and  graft  in the  latest  FIR  registered  by the  agency.  #
 *  The prosecutor said  JSPL  and  Gagan Sponge Iron  Limited,  also  a  firm  belonging  to  Jindal,  had  bagged  Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block  in  Birbhum  in  Jharkhand  in  2008  by  alleged  misrepresentation  of  facts  when  Rao  was  the  minister of State for  Coal.  #
 *  Within  a  year,  a  block  was  allocated  to  JSPL  in  January  2008,  CBI  sources  claimed,  noting  that  shares  of  Rao's  firm  Saubhagya  Media  listed  at  Rs  28  that  time  were  purchased  by  one  of  Jindal's  firm  New  Delhi  Exim  Limited  at  a  whopping  Rs  100  per  share  with  total  investment  of  nearly  Rs  2.25  crore  which  is  alleged  to be  illegal  gratification.  #
 *  Reacting  to the  development,  Head  of  External  Affairs,  JSPL,  Manu  Kapoor  had  said,  "JSPL,  as a  law  abiding  company, is governed by a strong ethical code of  conduct.  #
 *  This is an ongoing CBI investigation into  coal block  allocation.  #
 *  At this stage of investigation, JSPL is committed to fully cooperate with  CBI."  #
 *  Opposition  on  Monday  vociferously  raised  in the  Rajya Sabha  the  issue  of  crucial  files  of  Coal Ministry  going  missing,  alleging  that  it  was  a  conspiracy  to  save  the  Prime Minister  in the  multi-crore  coal block allocation  scam  being  probed  by the  CBI.  #
 *  The  opposition  sought  to  corner  the  government  by  demanding  a  statement  from  Prime Minister  or  Coal  Minister  affecting the  issue.  #
 *  Responding  to the  demand,  Minister of State for  Parliamentary  Affairs  Rajeev  Shukla  assured  the  House  that  coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal  will  make  a  statement  affecting the  issue  but  gave  no  time  frame.  #
 *  Raising  the  issue  during  Zero  Hour,  Dharmendra  Pradhan  (BJP)  said  such  an  incident  has  never  happened  earlier  for a  government  needs  to  reply.  #
 *  "This  is  a  very  serious  issue...Nothing  can  be  more  condemnable.  #
 *  This is  a  conspiracy...It  is  an  attempt  to  save  the  Prime  Minister,"  said  Pradhan,  wondering  if  the  coal  department  had  a  hand  in  missing  of  files  to  brush  under  the  carpet  irregularities  by  Prime Minister Manmohan  Singh,  who  earlier  held  the  Coal  portfolio.  #
 *  Leader  of  Opposition  Arun  Jaitley  said,  "There  are  three  powerful  targets  of  investigation  and  suddenly  the  files  are  missing...the  government  must  respond  to  this...Otherwise  you  eliminate  the  evidence  and  then  say  no  crime  is  committed."  #
 *  Jaitley  said,  "There  are  three  important  targets  of  investigation  -  the  beneficiaries  who  benefited  from  coal block  allocations,  the  screening committee  which  allotted  the  mines  for the  Minister,  the  Minister's  office  for the  Prime Minister's  Office."  #
 *  As  BJP  created  uproar  over  the  issue,  Shukla  said,  "We  will  apprise  the  Minister  and  he  will  make  a  statement  in the  House."  #
 *  While  BJP  insisted  that some  Coal  Minister  or  the  Prime Minister  should  come  to the  House  and  reply,  Deputy  Chairman  P  J  Kurien  observed  that the  matter  is  a  Zero  Hour  issue  for the  government  is  not  obliged  to  answer.  #
 *  BJP  on  Thursday  alleged  that  the scope of the coal scam  goes  all  the  way  to  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  since  he  was  the  final  signatory  for  all  the  allocations  and  sought  to  know  how  Coal Secretary  P  C  Parakh  is  being  held  responsible  but  not  the  minister  who  held  the  portfolio.  #

 *  The CBI  Director  today  admitted  before  the  Supreme Court  that the  changes  were  made  in the  coalgate  draft  report  on  suggestions  given  by  Union  Law Minister  Ashwani  Kumar,  Attorney  General  G E  Vanahvati  and a  officials  of  PMO  and  Coal  Ministry.  #
 *  In  its  nine-page  affidavit,  CBI  chief  Ranjit  Sinha  gave  details  of the  meetings  which  took  place  between  the  officials  of the  probe  agency,  the  Law  Minister,  AG,  then  Additional  Solicitor  General  Harin  Raval  and  officials  of  PMO  and  Coal  Ministry.  #
 *  The  submission  made  by  Sinha  contradicts  the  stand  taken  by the  Law Minister  and  AG,  who  had  refuted  the  allegation  that  they  had  suggested  changes  in the  draft  report.  #
 *  The  affidavit  said  the  changes  made  in the  draft  report  affecting the  suggestion  of the  Law Minister  and  Vanahvati  have  'neither  altered  the  report  nor  shifted  the  focus  of  inquiries  in  any  manner.'  #
 *  Sinha  also  said  that  'no  names  of  suspects  or  accused  were  removed  from  the  status report  and  also  that  no  suspect  or  accused  was  let  off  in the  process.'  #
 *  "Majority  of  these  changes  were  done  by  my  officers  in  order  to  refine  the  report  either  on  their  own  or  in  consultation  with  the  ASG  (Raval)  and  his  assisting  advocate  or  by  Law  minister.  #
 *  Besides,  a  few  changes  were  also  done  on the  suggestion  of  AG  and  officials  of  PMO  and  Coal  Ministry,"  Sinha  said.  #
 *  The  Director,  however,  said,  It is  difficult  at  this  stage  to  attribute  each  change  to  a  particular  person  with  certainty."  #
 *  The CBI  chief  in  his  affidavit  also  referred  to  certain  changes  made  in the  final  status report  on the  suggestion  of the  law  minister,  the  AG,  for the  officials  of  PMO  and  coal  ministry.  #
 *  Amid  controversy  raging  over  the  missing files  on  mines  allotment,  the  Coal Ministry  on  Tuesday  said  it  is  in the  process  of  locating  the  documents  and  will  update  the CBI  about  the  matter  within  2-3  days.  #
 *  "CBI  has been  informed  about  the  documents  that  could  be  located.  #
 *  Further,  update  will  be  furnished  in the  next  2-3  days  and the  detailed  report  will  be  submitted  by  September  13,  2013,"  an  official  statement  said  here.  #
 *  "These  documents  are  in the  process  of  getting  reconciled  with  the  investigating  agency,"  the  statement  said.  #
 *  Earlier  in the  day  coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal  said:  #
 *  "The  list  of the  (files)  which  could  not  be  located  would  be  handed  over  to  CBI  either  on  Wednesday  or  by  Friday.  #
 *  "Then  lodge  FIR  (against  the  missing  files)  or  take  appropriate  action."  #
 *  Meanwhile,  the  Coal Ministry  today  reviewed  the  efforts  being  made  to  locate  the  documents  mentioned  in the  lists  sent  by  CBI.  #
 *  The  meeting  was  attended  by  senior  officials  of the  ministries  of  coal,  steel  and  power  among  others.  #
 *  The  statement  said:  #
 *  "It is  seen  that some  officers  of the  various  search  teams  which  had  been  constituted  and the  said  purpose  had  worked  hard  including  on  Saturdays  and  Sundays  to  locate  all  such  documents.  #
 *  "These  teams  had  searched  documents  in the  ministry,  in  Lok  Nayak  Bhawan,  in the  Ranchi  Office  of  CMPDIL  and  in the  offices  of  Coal  India  Ltd,  including  its  subsidiary  coal  companies."  #
 *  Social  activist  Anna  Hazare  today  demanded  that  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  should  step  down  from  his  post,  accepting  "moral  responsibility"  and the  coal blocks allocation  scam.  #
 *  "The  picture  is  very  clear  in the  coal  scam.  #
 *  The  truth  of the  scam  is  coming  out,  so  Manmohan  Singh  should  not  continue  as  Prime  Minister.  #
 *  He  should  resign  accepting  moral  responsibility  (for  the  scam),"  he  said.  #
 *  To  a  question,  the  anti-corruption  crusader  said,  It is  absolutely  wrong  to  say  that  I  am  against  Congress.  #
 *  I  have  nothing  to  do  with  either  BJP  or  Congress.  #
 *  But  my  question  is  why  BJP  did  not  oppose  the  coal  scam  in  Parliament  in  a  forceful  way?"  #
 *  On  Gujarat  Chief  Narendra  Modi  being  branded  a  "communal"  leader  in  certain  quarters,  the  Gandhian  said,  "I  have  not  come  across  any  evidence  suggesting  that  Modi  is  a  communal  leader.  #
 *  But  why  to  talk  of  Modi  or  Rahul  Gandhi,  the  fact  is  as  long  as a  Prime Minister  is  affiliated  to  a  political  party,  the  country  won't  get  the  right  leadership."  #
 *  "The  right  Prime Minister  can  be  elected  only  through  a  direct  election  by the  people,"  he  said.  #
 *  Hazare  said  he  would  not  support  the  Arvind  Kejriwal-led  Aam  Admi  Party  as  it  too  is  a  political  outfit.  #
 *  Asked  whether  India  too  can  witness  a  people's  uprising  like  in  Egypt,  Hazare  said,  "If  the  Government  crosses  certain  limits  and  remains  oblivious  to  people's  problems,  the  country  may  move  towards  the  path  of  non-violent  revolution."  #
 *  Ruing  the  virtual  wash-out  of the  just  concluded  monsoon  session  of  Parliament,  DMK  chief  M  Karunanidhi  today  said  a  debate  on  alleged  losses  relating  to  mining  of  coal  would  have  brought  out  the  truth.  #
 *  "One  cannot  help  but  suspect  if  there  is  no  truth  in  Opposition  (BJP's)  claims  despite  Prime Minister's  willingness  to  debate  the  issue.  #
 *  People  of the  country  would  have  understood  the  truth  if  government  replied  to  claims  of  wrongdoings  as  alleged  by the  Opposition,"  he  said.  #
 *  Responding  to  questions  in  party  organ  'Murasoli,'  he  said  #
 *  over  70  per cent  of  business  hours  were  lost  in  both  houses  of  Parliament  due  to  opposition  stalling  proceedings  and  bills  like  the  one  providing  reservation  in  job  promotions.  #
 *  "While  Opposition  is  repeatedly  levelling  charges,  did  losses  to the  tune  of  Rs  1.86  lakh  crore  really  happen  over  coal blocks allocation  ?  #
 *  Only  debate  can  ensure  if  the  losses  (if  any)  could  be  compensated,"  he  said.  #
 *  He  also  opposed  any  move  to  sell  stakes  in the  Neyveli  Lignite  Corporation  and  requested  the  Prime Minister  to  intervene  to  prevent  any  such  decision.  #
 *  The  Centre  Monday  admitted  before  the  Supreme Court  that  it  provided  certain  coal blocks  to  private  companies  for  captive  mining  although  these  blocks  fell  in  areas  where  the  Coal  India  Ltd  (CIL)  already  had  existing  leases.  #
 *  Seeking  to  justify  such  allocations,  the  government,  in  its  affidavit,  stated  that  five  such  blocks  were  allocated  under  the  Mines  and  Minerals  (Development  and  Regulation)  Act.  #
 *  However,  it  is  a  well-known  fact  that  these  coal blocks  were  acquired  by the  government  under  the  Coal  Bearing  Areas  (CBA)  Act.  #
 *  Hence,  the  Centre  may  find  itself  in  trouble  on  Tuesday  when  the  court  examines  its  explanation.  #
 *  A  Bench  led  by  Justice  R  M  Lodha  had  to  adjourn  the  hearing  last  week  after  the  Attorney  General  sought  some  time  to  explain  how  certain  coal blocks  belonging  to the  lease-hold  areas  of the  CIL  were  allocated  to  private  companies.  #
 *  "If  these  coal blocks  identified  by  CIL  and  Central  Mine  Planning  and  Design  Institute  Limited  (CMPDIL)  are  part  of the  lease  hold  area  of  CIL,  then  how  can  further  rights  could  be  created  in favour of  other  companies?"  the  Bench  had  asked  G E  Vahanvati,  who  requested  for  some  time  to  file  an  affidavit  affecting the  issue.  #
 *  In  its  affidavit,  the  Coal Ministry  has  now  conceded:  #
 *  "Out  of  47  blocks  allocated  to  private  parties  from  1993  till  2005,  five  blocks  were  located  in  an  area  where  there  was  a  subsisting  mining  lease  or  were  subject  matter  of  CBA  Act  notification  in favour of  CIL  subsidiaries."  #
 *  Further,  the  government  has  failed  in  adducing  any  information  about  three  out  of the  five  blocks,  saying  the  information  was  still  being  sought.  #
 *  On  remaining  two  blocks,  it  has  said  in  one  case,  a  sub-lease  was  granted  to  a  private  company  while  in the  other,  the  mining  lease  was  surrendered  by the  CIL  subsidiary  and  then  the  private  company  obtained  a  mining  lease  from  the  state  government  under  the  MMDR  Act.  #
 *  Unfazed  by the  Opposition  attack,  Congress  President  Sonia  Gandhi  today  dismissed  the  demand  and a  resignation  of  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  over  the  coalgate  issue.  #
 *  "Let  them  ask"  was  the  terse  response  of  Gandhi  when  approached  by  reporters  on the  issue  after  a  meeting  of the  Congress  Core  Group  headed  by  her.  #
 *  The  meeting  of the  Core  Group  was  convened  immediately  after  both  Houses  were  adjourned  over  the  issue  for  half  an  hour  in the  morning.  #
 *  The  meeting,  which  was  also  attended  by  Parliamentary  Affairs  Minister  Kamal  Nath  discussed  the  strategy  ahead  in  wake  of the  Opposition  reviving  its  attack  affecting the  government  affecting the  coalgate  issue  and  bringing  the  Prime Minister  as  well  under  the  target.  #
 *  Keeping  up  the  heat  on the  government,  BJP  today  demanded  resignation  of  Prime Minister  on the  coalgate  issue.  #
 *  Gandhi  had  yesterday  also  given  an  indication  of the  aggression  in  Congress'  response  to the  Opposition's  charges.  #
 *  Addressing  an  alumni  meet  of  NSU,  she  had  asked  partymen  to  fight  back  by  not  allowing  its  opponents  "to  get  away  with  propagating  negative  impressions".  #
 *  "Why  should  we  allow  our  opponents  to  get  away  with  propagating  negative  impressions?  #
 *  You  should  ask  them:  "what  have  you  or  your  party  done  to  change  things  in  our  country  ?"  #
 *  I  have  no  doubt  that  they  have  no  credible  answer,"  Gandhi  #
 *  had  said.  #
 *  In  the  Lok Sabha  today,  soon  after  Speaker  Meira  Kumar  made  a  reference  to  Panchayati  Raj  Day,  opposition  members  rushed  to the  Well  raising  slogans  and  waving  placards  on  various  issues.  #
 *  BJP  members  rushed  to the  Well  demanding  resignation  of the  Prime Minister  over  the  issue  of  coal block  allocations.  #
 *  Shouting  slogans,  they  also  demanded  dismissal  of  Law Minister Ashwani Kumar  who  is  alleged  to  have  vetted  the CBI  report  to the  Supreme  Court.  #
 *  BJP  spokesperson  and  former  MP  Kirit  Somaiya  has  alleged  that  Congress MP  Vijay  Darda  is  involved  in the  coal  mine  allocation  scam.  #
 *  Somaiya  alleged  that  Darda's  companies  had  formed  joint  ventures  with  companies  belonging  to  friends  and  relatives  of  coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal  and  that  Jaiswal's  influence  was  exerted  to  allot  nine  coal blocks  to  these  companies  from  2006-2008.  #
 *  Darda  refuted  the  charges,  saying  Somaiya's  "so-called  unearthing  of  scam  was  not  based  on  facts."  #
 *  Somaiya  claimed  that  joint  ventures  Jawaharlal  Darda  Yavatmal  Energy,  JAS  Infrastructure  and  Power,  Jayaswal  Neco,  Abhijeet  Infrastructure  and  so  on  were  allocated  coal blocks  at  Fatehpur  and  Gare  Palma  in  Chhattisgarh  and  Sasai,  Brinda,  Moitra  and  Meral  in  Jharkhand.  #
 *  "The  total  estimated  current  value  of  these  coal blocks  is  up  to  Rs  25,000  crore.  #
 *  These  blocks  have been  allotted  in  a  non-transparent  and  scandalous  manner.  #
 *  Vijay  Darda  and  family  are  in  JV  with  the  Jayaswal  Group  of  Companies  and  have  got  these  contracts  by  creating  an  artificial  net  of  companies  to  deceive  people,"  said  Somaiya.  #
 *  Darda,  however,  said  that  his  family  quit  the  company  after  it  did  not  get  the  coal blocks  in  Yavatmal.  #
 *  "In  2006  when  there  was  a  severe  deficit  in the  supply  of  power,  cement  and  steel,  the  central  government  had  started  a  scheme  to  attract  private  players.  #
 *  In  2007,  I  signed  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  with  the  then  chief  minister  late  Vilasrao  Deshmukh  in  which  I  stated  that  if  I  get  coal  for  power  generation,  I  will  provide  free  electricity  to  farmers  in  Yavatmal  for  five  years  as the  region  recorded  the  maximum  number  of  farmer  suicides.  #
 *  I  also  said  private  companies  would  be  sold  power  at  Rs  2  a  unit  instead  of the  then  rate  of  Rs  2.4.  #
 *  For  reasons  I  cannot  disclose,  I  did  not  get  the  coalfield  in  Yavatmal  but  instead  in  Chhattisgarh  and  Jharkhand,  which  defeated  the  purpose.  #
 *  Thus,  our  family  quit  the  company,"  said  Darda.  #
 *  Attacking  the  Centre  on the  coal blocks allocation  controversy,  Gujarat  Chief  Minister  Narendra  Modi  today  said  the  scam  was  "blackening  the  country's  face".  #
 *  "On  the  lines  of  Gujarat,  the  Centre  had  decided  to  distribute  soil  health  cards  to  farmers.  #
 *  I  don't  know  when  they  are  going  to  do  this.  #
 *  They  are  stuck  in  coal  (scam),"  Modi  said,  addressing  a  national  convention  on  agri-business  here.  #
 *  "The  scam  is  blackening  the  country's  face,  as  Delhi  has  got  mired  in  coal."  #
 *  The  Chief  Minister  also  claimed  that  Gujarat  was  the  only  state  where  industrial  and  agricultural  development  were  taking  place  simultaneously.  #
 *  "National  average  of  agriculture  growth  is  2-3  per  cent,  but  Gujarat  has  grown  at  10  per cent  in the  last  decade,"  Modi  said.  #
 *  In  the  last  ten  years,  seven  lakh  hectares  of  land  was  brought  under  micro-irrigation  in the  state,  whereas  only  a  thousand  hectares  had  been  brought  under  micro-irrigation  in the  previous  40  years,  he  said.  #
 *  Farmers  from  several  states  attended  the  convention.  #
 *  Modi  announced  that  Gujarat  would  organize  'international  agri  fair'  every  three  years,  on the  lines  of  'Agritech'  in  Israel,  where  latest  technology  and  global  trends  would  be  showcased.  #
 *  Modi  also  announced  that  an  agricultural  institute  would  be  set  up  in  Gujarat  in  collaboration  with  Israel.  #
 *  "The  degree  of  an  Israeli  university  would  be  awarded  to the  students,"  he  said.  #
 *  Speaking  on  this  occasion,  Israel  Counsel  General  Orna  Sagi  said  her  country  was  celebrating  20  years  of  bilateral  trade  relations  with  India.  #
 *  "In  1992,  the  bilateral  trade  with  India  was  USD  180  million,  and  today  it  is  USD  5  billion.  #
 *  Agriculture  has been  an  instrumental  part  of  this  growth,"  Sagi  said.  #
 *  Sagi  also  announced  that  Israel  would  establish  three  Centres  of  Excellence  in  Gujarat,  for  vegetables,  mango  and  post-harvest  processing  of  dates  and  banana.  #
 *  The  coal  scam  resurfaced  today  following  reports  of  alleged  government  interference  in  CBI  investigations  with  the  BJP  demanding  an  SIT  probe  into  it  but  the  Congress  firmly  rejected  the  charge  and  also  ruled  out  the  resignation  of  Law Minister  Ashwani  Kumar.  #
 *  Leader  of the  Opposition  in  Rajya Sabha  Arun  Jaitley  targeted  the  UPA  by  accusing  it  of  being  a  "rogue  government"  that  will  not  allow  CBI  to  function  independently  and  demanded  constitution  of  a  Special  Investigation  Team.  #
 *  He  also  charged  the  government  with  "interference  in the  administration  of  justice"  by  not  allowing  CBI  to  acquaint  the  this court  with  the  full  truth  in the  case.  #
 *  "CBI  cannot  find  out  the  truth  and  even  if  some  honest  officer  in the  CBI  tries  to  find  out  the  truth,  the  UPA  is  a  rogue  government  which  will  not  allow  it  to  operate  #
 *  independently,"  Jaitley  said.  #
 *  His  Rajya Sabha  counterpart,  Sushma  Swaraj,  criticised  the  government  for  "vetting"  of the  CBI  report  and  said  it  is  part  of  "an  attempt  to  save  Prime Minister Manmohan  Singh".  #
 *  JD(U)  spokesperson  Shivanand  Tiwari  also  termed  the  reports  as  "very  serious",  saying  this  is  contempt  of  court.  #
 *  "Supreme  Court  is  asking  CBI  to  submit  its  report  and  government  is  toning  it  down.  #
 *  This is  for a  first  time  to  my  knowledge  that  such  a  thing  is  happening."  #
 *  The  Opposition's  attack  on the  issue  came  in the  wake  of  reports  that  Law Minister Ashwani Kumar  summoned  CBI  Chief  for the  report  was  changed  and  toned  down  after  the  meeting.  #
 *  Unfazed  by the  attack,  Congress  rejected  the  charge  of  interference  in the  preparation  of  CBI  report  in the  coal  scam  for a  Supreme Court  and  ruled  out  resignation  of  #
 *  Law Minister Ashwani Kumar  in  this  regard.  #
 *  "There  is  no  question  of  resignation  of  Law Minister  Ashwani  Kumar.  #
 *  Supreme Court  has  already  asked  CBI  to  file  an  affidaviat  in  this  regard.  #
 *  CBI  will  file  its  affidavit  and  truth  will  come  out,"  party  spokesperson  Rashid  Alvi  said.  #
 *  The  CPI-M  on  Friday  accused  Commerce  Minister  Anand  Sharma  of  trying  to  intimidate  the CBI  by  defending  an  industrialist  being  investigated  by the  agency  in the  allocation of coal  blocks.  #
 *  "It is  shocking  that  a  union  minister,  Anand  Sharma,  has  come  out  in  defence  of  a  big  industrialist  claiming  he  is  innocent  in the  case,"  the  Communist  Party  of  India-Marxist  said.  #
 *  "This  is  nothing  but  a  blatant  effort  to  influence  the  case  and  intimidate  the CBI  (Central  Bureau  of  Investigation),"  it  said.  #
 *  The CBI  has  lodged  an  FIR  against  the  chairman  of  Hindalco  and  former coal secretary  P.C.  #
 *  Parakh  in  a  coal blocks allocation  case  as  part  of the  ongoing  investigation  into  the  coal block  allocation.  #
 *  The  CPI-M  said  it  had  been  demanding  a  thorough  investigation  into  the  illegal  allocation of  natural  resources  "to  ensure  windfall  profits  to  certain  companies.  #
 *  "Since  this  involved  the  period  when  Prime Minister  (Manmohan  Singh)  was  in  charge  of the  coal  ministry,  this  aspect  also  needs  investigation."  #
 *  The  CPI-M  said  that  minister  Sharma's  stand  "is  also  to  justify  the  covert  policy  of  privatizing  the  coal  industry  which  is  the  root  cause  for a  corruption  involved".  #
 *  The  CPI-M  urged  the CBI  to  proceed  in the  entire  investigation  and  pursue  the  guilty  without  fear  or  favour.  #
 *  In  a  swift  operation,  CBI  on  Friday  night  arrested  its  own  superintendent  of  police  (SP)  heading  the  team  probing  the  coal  scam  and  an  inspector  for  allegedly  taking  a  bribe  of  Rs.7  lakh  from  a  businessman  outside  the  agency's  headquarters  here  to  settle  a  land  dispute.  #
 *  CBI's  internal  vigilance  apprehended  Inspector  Rajesh  while  receiving  the  bribe  on  behalf  of  SP  Vivek  Dutt  who  was  chief  investigator  in the  coal blocks allocation  scam  case.  #
 *  "We  had  information  about  such  a  dealing  and  we  continiued  to  maintain  surveillance  on  them.  #
 *  After  monitoring  them  for  pretty  long,  today  they  were  arrested  for  taking  the  bribe,"  CBI Director Ranjit Sinha  said.  #
 *  He  said  the CBI  would  inform  the  Supreme Court  soon  about  the  developments  since  the  apex court  had  ruled  that  no  official  associated  with  the  probe into the  scam  would  be  transferred  without  informing  it.  #
 *  CBI sources said  the  agency  got  a  tip-off  that  Dutt,  who  was  posted  in  its  Economic  Offences  Wing,  had  allegedly  struck  a  deal  to  settle  a  land  dispute  in  return  for  illegal  gratification.  #
 *  They said  Dutt  had  allegedly  used  his  influence  with  Delhi  Police  officials  to  withdraw  a  petition  from  an  ongoing  land  dispute  case,  which  had  benefitted  the  businessman.  #
 *  The  vigilance  officials  got  the  tip  off  that certain  alleged  deal  would  materialise  this  evening  and  informed  the CBI  director  about  it  who  gave  the  go-ahead.  #
 *  The  agency's  internal  vigilance  then  arrested  Rajesh  when  the  money  was  changing  hands.  #
 *  Later,  Dutt  was  also  taken  into  custody.  #
 *  The  agency  sources  said  the  bribery  case  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  ongoing  coal blocks allocation scam case in  which  Dutt  was  the  chief  investigator.  #
 *  The  operation  was  carried out  on  a  day  when  senior  officials  of  CBI  from  across  the  country  had  congregated  at  the  agency  headquarters  for  their  quarterly  zonal  meeting.  #
 *  "My  aim  while  taking  over  as  CBI  director  was  to  ensure  zero  tolerance  of  corruption,"  Sinha  said.  #
 *  In  another  high  profile  chargesheet  in the  coal  scam,  the  Central Bureau of Investigation  has  named  Aditya Birla  Group  Chairman  Kumar Mangalam Birla,  in  its  14th  FIR  in the  case.  #
 *  FIRs  have been  filed  against  Kumar Mangalam Birla  NALCO,  HINDALCO  and  former  secretary  coal  PC  Parakh.  #
 *  Cases  of  cheating,  forgery  and  financial  misrepresentation  have been  filed.  #
 *  CBI  searches  are  also  on  in  Delhi,  Kolkata,  Bhubaneswar  and  Mumbai  in connection with  the  coal  scam.  #
 *  Sources  say  that  in the  FIR  against  Birla,  the  name  of the  concerned  coal block  in  question  is  Talabira II  in the  Jasakuda  district  of  Odisha.  #
 *  This  coal block  was  allocated  in  2005.  #
 *  The  Aditya Birla  Group  has  issued  a  statement  saying,  "Did  not  receive  any  FIR  copy  and  there  is  no  reason  for  it."  #
 *  The  FIR  says  HINDALCO  did  not  fulfill  requirements  of  coal block  but  was  unduly  favoured  by the  government.  #
 *  Earlier  Congress MP  and  industrialist  Naveen  Jindal  was  summoned  by the  CBI  in  September  and  was  subjected  to  some  intense  scrutiny.  #
 *  Naveen  has been  named  as  an investor in the  twelfth  FIR  of the  CBI  in  coal  scan.  #
 *  The CBI  in  its  FIR  has  said  that  Naveen's  company,  Jindal  Group,  was  not  recommended  by the  Jharkhand  government.  #
 *  The  FIR  also  accused  him  of  misrepresentation  of  facts.  #
 *  The  Supreme Court  on  Thursday  expressed  unhappiness  with  the  Central Bureau of  Investigation's  pace  in  probing  the  coal block allocation  scam.  #
 *  Pullign  up  the  agency,  the  this court  urged  the CBI  to  pick  up  some  speed.  #
 *  In  fact,  the  court  asked  the  agency  to  change  gears  and  fast  track  the  probe.  #
 *  The CBI  in  reply  assured  the  apex court  that certain  probe  would  be  completed  in  four-five  months  and  it  will  complete  its  inquiry  against  169  companies.  #
 *  The  Supreme Court  also  asked  the  Centre  why  an  FIR  was  not  filed  over  the  missing  documents  even  after  three  months  and  29  days  have  passed.  #
 *  The  court  said  truth  has  to  come  out  if  it  was  an  attempt  to  destroy  the  records.  #
 *  The  apex court  slammed  the  government  for  not  sharing  files,  documents  with  the CBI  relating  to  coal  scam.  #
 *  The  status report  given  by the  CBI  gives  up-to-date  details  of  investigation  that  the CBI  has  carried out  till  August  25.  #
 *  The  status report  that  was  submitted  in  a  sealed  envelope  runs  into  eight  volumes.  #
 *  The CBI  had  sought  the  Supreme  Court's  permission  to  share  its  probe  report  with  its  prosecutor  in the  case.  #
 *  The CBI  had  also  told  the  apex court  that  no  prior  sanction  for  approval  of  government  is  necessary  to  enquire  against  government  officials  in the  coal  scam  investigation.  #
 *  It  had  also  submitted  a  list  of  petitions  seeking  more  powers  for the  CBI.  #
 *  The  Centre  on  Tuesday  admitted  before  the  Supreme Court  that  189  out  of  236  documents  sought  by the  CBI,  which  is  probing  coal block allocation  scam,  is  "not-available".  #
