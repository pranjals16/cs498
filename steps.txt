1) show that equivalence classes are different for commentary and random data

2) extract features such as unigrams,bigrams, POS, VERB CLASS, voice(voice of verbs)(generally similar texts are in same voice)

				OR
3) remove punctuations
4) PCFG and then PLSA

IDEA:
a same topic document will have strong clustering in PLSA with.
stemming using porter's suffix-stripping
words with same meaning can be clustered together because they reduce recall
words with multiple meanings reduce precision. they can occur in multiple topics
less frequent words should be kept only upto a threshold


*** using this method we can also predict some important categories in a document and can be used to filter sentences corresponding to it
** if there are many important categories with very less clustering around each one of them, it means corpus is distributed


Problem: How to set k in PLSA/k-means clustering
