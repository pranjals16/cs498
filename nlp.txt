Twitter Data->Polls
--------------------

** we can answer some popular poll questions from the data. e.g. if many people describe something popular about Sachin, we can very easily answer that large number of people follow him.

** this approach saves us precious time and money of conducting polls

** a large variety of topics to consider for poll in this case

** Twitter data will be used as it easily available online or can be extracted through Twitter API

** Our results will also have Demographics as one of the factors

** paper mainly talks about surveys on consumer confidence but we have different topics to study

Approach:

i) Filter messages related to topic(keyword filtering, synonym filtering or any other better approach) -> wordnet can be used for this
	- PLSA or k-means clustering can be used to figure out hidden topics(different from the paper)

ii) whether these messages are positive or negative to the topic
	
	- Opinion Finder categorizes words as positive and negative
	- this is one of the important steps as quality of lexicons here will affect the result a lot	
iii) Analyze positive sentiment on a topic for few days and give the prediction (smoothing may be required)


Problems:
i) very scattered data
ii) lot of noise(e.g. emoticons)

Document Classification
--------------------------

** k-means clustering with many similarity measures(such as Cosine, Euclidean, Pearson Coefficient,etc)
** in this way we can compare several approaches
** need to model the document(bags can be used, each bag is a group of similar words with certain weights, frequency in this case)
** these bags will act as vectors in clustering
** weka machine learning workbench removes stop words
** porter's suffix stripping can be used (e.g. production-> produce)
** words only above a certain threshold frequency shall be used
** stop words and unnecessary words(such as a,of,the) needs to be filtered out. they act as noise

Problems
-----------

** most frequent word may not be the appropriate measure
